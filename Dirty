1 Overview
**********

GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
retrieval through HTTP proxies.

   This chapter is a partial overview of Wgetâ€™s features.

   â€¢ Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
     background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
     start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
     finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require
     constant userâ€™s presence, which can be a great hindrance when
     transferring a lot of data.

   â€¢ Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create
     local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory
     structure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as
     â€œrecursive downloading.â€ While doing that, Wget respects the Robot
     Exclusion Standard (â€˜/robots.txtâ€™).  Wget can be instructed to
     convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files,
     for offline viewing.

   â€¢ File name wildcard matching and recursive mirroring of directories
     are available when retrieving via FTP.  Wget can read the
     time-stamp information given by both HTTP and FTP servers, and
     store it locally.  Thus Wget can see if the remote file has changed
     since last retrieval, and automatically retrieve the new version if
     it has.  This makes Wget suitable for mirroring of FTP sites, as
     well as home pages.

   â€¢ Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
     connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
     keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the
     server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue
     the download from where it left off.

   â€¢ Wget supports proxy servers, which can lighten the network load,
     speed up retrieval and provide access behind firewalls.  Wget uses
     the passive FTP downloading by default, active FTP being an option.

   â€¢ Wget supports IP version 6, the next generation of IP. IPv6 is
     autodetected at compile-time, and can be disabled at either build
     or run time.  Binaries built with IPv6 support work well in both
     IPv4-only and dual family environments.

   â€¢ Built-in features offer mechanisms to tune which links you wish to
     follow (*note Following Links::).

   â€¢ The progress of individual downloads is traced using a progress
     gauge.  Interactive downloads are tracked using a
     â€œthermometerâ€-style gauge, whereas non-interactive ones are traced
     with dots, each dot representing a fixed amount of data received
     (1KB by default).  Either gauge can be customized to your
     preferences.

   â€¢ Most of the features are fully configurable, either through command
     line options, or via the initialization file â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ (*note
     Startup File::).  Wget allows you to define â€œglobalâ€ startup files
     (â€˜/usr/local/etc/wgetrcâ€™ by default) for site settings.  You can
     also specify the location of a startup file with the â€“config
     option.  To disable the reading of config files, use â€“no-config.
     If both â€“config and â€“no-config are given, â€“no-config is ignored.

   â€¢ Finally, GNU Wget is free software.  This means that everyone may
     use it, redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
     General Public License, as published by the Free Software
     Foundation (see the file â€˜COPYINGâ€™ that came with GNU Wget, for
     details).

2 Invoking
**********

By default, Wget is very simple to invoke.  The basic syntax is:

     wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

   Wget will simply download all the URLs specified on the command line.
URL is a â€œUniform Resource Locatorâ€, as defined below.

   However, you may wish to change some of the default parameters of
Wget.  You can do it two ways: permanently, adding the appropriate
command to â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ (*note Startup File::), or specifying it on the
command line.

2.1 URL Format
==============

â€œURLâ€ is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  A uniform resource
locator is a compact string representation for a resource available via
the Internet.  Wget recognizes the URL syntax as per RFC1738.  This is
the most widely used form (square brackets denote optional parts):

     http://host[:port]/directory/file
     ftp://host[:port]/directory/file

   You can also encode your username and password within a URL:

     ftp://user:password@host/path
     http://user:password@host/path

   Either USER or PASSWORD, or both, may be left out.  If you leave out
either the HTTP username or password, no authentication will be sent.
If you leave out the FTP username, â€˜anonymousâ€™ will be used.  If you
leave out the FTP password, your email address will be supplied as a
default password.(1)

   *Important Note*: if you specify a password-containing URL on the
command line, the username and password will be plainly visible to all
users on the system, by way of â€˜psâ€™.  On multi-user systems, this is a
big security risk.  To work around it, use â€˜wget -i -â€™ and feed the URLs
to Wgetâ€™s standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by â€˜C-dâ€™.

   You can encode unsafe characters in a URL as â€˜%xyâ€™, â€˜xyâ€™ being the
hexadecimal representation of the characterâ€™s ASCII value.  Some common
unsafe characters include â€˜%â€™ (quoted as â€˜%25â€™), â€˜:â€™ (quoted as â€˜%3Aâ€™),
and â€˜@â€™ (quoted as â€˜%40â€™).  Refer to RFC1738 for a comprehensive list of
unsafe characters.

   Wget also supports the â€˜typeâ€™ feature for FTP URLs.  By default, FTP
documents are retrieved in the binary mode (type â€˜iâ€™), which means that
they are downloaded unchanged.  Another useful mode is the â€˜aâ€™ (â€œASCIIâ€)
mode, which converts the line delimiters between the different operating
systems, and is thus useful for text files.  Here is an example:

     ftp://host/directory/file;type=a

   Two alternative variants of URL specification are also supported,
because of historical (hysterical?)  reasons and their widespreaded use.

   FTP-only syntax (supported by â€˜NcFTPâ€™):
     host:/dir/file

   HTTP-only syntax (introduced by â€˜Netscapeâ€™):
     host[:port]/dir/file

   These two alternative forms are deprecated, and may cease being
supported in the future.

   If you do not understand the difference between these notations, or
do not know which one to use, just use the plain ordinary format you use
with your favorite browser, like â€˜Lynxâ€™ or â€˜Netscapeâ€™.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you have a â€˜.netrcâ€™ file in your home directory, password will
also be searched for there.

2.2 Option Syntax
=================

Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments, every
option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more
convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix
different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
arguments.  Thus you may write:

     wget -r --tries=10 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/ -o log

   The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument
may be omitted.  Instead of â€˜-o logâ€™ you can write â€˜-ologâ€™.

   You may put several options that do not require arguments together,
like:

     wget -drc URL

   This is completely equivalent to:

     wget -d -r -c URL

   Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
terminate them with â€˜--â€™.  So the following will try to download URL
â€˜-xâ€™, reporting failure to â€˜logâ€™:

     wget -o log -- -x

   The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be
useful to clear the â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ settings.  For instance, if your â€˜.wgetrcâ€™
sets â€˜exclude_directoriesâ€™ to â€˜/cgi-binâ€™, the following example will
first reset it, and then set it to exclude â€˜/~nobodyâ€™ and â€˜/~somebodyâ€™.
You can also clear the lists in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ (*note Wgetrc Syntax::).

     wget -X '' -X /~nobody,/~somebody

   Most options that do not accept arguments are â€œbooleanâ€ options, so
named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no (â€œbooleanâ€)
variable.  For example, â€˜--follow-ftpâ€™ tells Wget to follow FTP links
from HTML files and, on the other hand, â€˜--no-globâ€™ tells it not to
perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A boolean option is either
â€œaffirmativeâ€ or â€œnegativeâ€ (beginning with â€˜--noâ€™).  All such options
share several properties.

   Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is
the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the
documented existence of â€˜--follow-ftpâ€™ assumes that the default is to
_not_ follow FTP links from HTML pages.

   Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the â€˜--no-â€™ to the
option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the â€˜--no-â€™
prefix.  This might seem superfluousâ€”if the default for an affirmative
option is to not do something, then why provide a way to explicitly turn
it off?  But the startup file may in fact change the default.  For
instance, using â€˜follow_ftp = onâ€™ in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ makes Wget _follow_ FTP
links by default, and using â€˜--no-follow-ftpâ€™ is the only way to restore
the factory default from the command line.

2.3 Basic Startup Options
=========================

â€˜-Vâ€™
â€˜--versionâ€™
     Display the version of Wget.

â€˜-hâ€™
â€˜--helpâ€™
     Print a help message describing all of Wgetâ€™s command-line options.

â€˜-bâ€™
â€˜--backgroundâ€™
     Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is
     specified via the â€˜-oâ€™, output is redirected to â€˜wget-logâ€™.

â€˜-e COMMANDâ€™
â€˜--execute COMMANDâ€™
     Execute COMMAND as if it were a part of â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ (*note Startup
     File::).  A command thus invoked will be executed _after_ the
     commands in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™, thus taking precedence over them.  If you
     need to specify more than one wgetrc command, use multiple
     instances of â€˜-eâ€™.

2.4 Logging and Input File Options
==================================

â€˜-o LOGFILEâ€™
â€˜--output-file=LOGFILEâ€™
     Log all messages to LOGFILE.  The messages are normally reported to
     standard error.

â€˜-a LOGFILEâ€™
â€˜--append-output=LOGFILEâ€™
     Append to LOGFILE.  This is the same as â€˜-oâ€™, only it appends to
     LOGFILE instead of overwriting the old log file.  If LOGFILE does
     not exist, a new file is created.

â€˜-dâ€™
â€˜--debugâ€™
     Turn on debug output, meaning various information important to the
     developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your system
     administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without debug
     support, in which case â€˜-dâ€™ will not work.  Please note that
     compiling with debug support is always safeâ€”Wget compiled with the
     debug support will _not_ print any debug info unless requested with
     â€˜-dâ€™.  *Note Reporting Bugs::, for more information on how to use
     â€˜-dâ€™ for sending bug reports.

â€˜-qâ€™
â€˜--quietâ€™
     Turn off Wgetâ€™s output.

â€˜-vâ€™
â€˜--verboseâ€™
     Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default
     output is verbose.

â€˜-nvâ€™
â€˜--no-verboseâ€™
     Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use â€˜-qâ€™ for
     that), which means that error messages and basic information still
     get printed.

â€˜--report-speed=TYPEâ€™
     Output bandwidth as TYPE.  The only accepted value is â€˜bitsâ€™.

â€˜-i FILEâ€™
â€˜--input-file=FILEâ€™
     Read URLs from a local or external FILE.  If â€˜-â€™ is specified as
     FILE, URLs are read from the standard input.  (Use â€˜./-â€™ to read
     from a file literally named â€˜-â€™.)

     If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the command
     line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and in an input
     file, those on the command lines will be the first ones to be
     retrieved.  If â€˜--force-htmlâ€™ is not specified, then FILE should
     consist of a series of URLs, one per line.

     However, if you specify â€˜--force-htmlâ€™, the document will be
     regarded as â€˜htmlâ€™.  In that case you may have problems with
     relative links, which you can solve either by adding â€˜<base
     href="URL">â€™ to the documents or by specifying â€˜--base=URLâ€™ on the
     command line.

     If the FILE is an external one, the document will be automatically
     treated as â€˜htmlâ€™ if the Content-Type matches â€˜text/htmlâ€™.
     Furthermore, the FILEâ€™s location will be implicitly used as base
     href if none was specified.

â€˜--input-metalink=FILEâ€™
     Downloads files covered in local Metalink FILE.  Metalink version 3
     and 4 are supported.

â€˜--keep-badhashâ€™
     Keeps downloaded Metalinkâ€™s files with a bad hash.  It appends
     .badhash to the name of Metalinkâ€™s files which have a checksum
     mismatch, except without overwriting existing files.

â€˜--metalink-over-httpâ€™
     Issues HTTP HEAD request instead of GET and extracts Metalink
     metadata from response headers.  Then it switches to Metalink
     download.  If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls back to
     ordinary HTTP download.  Enables â€˜Content-Type:
     application/metalink4+xmlâ€™ files download/processing.

â€˜--metalink-index=NUMBERâ€™
     Set the Metalink â€˜application/metalink4+xmlâ€™ metaurl ordinal
     NUMBER. From 1 to the total number of â€œapplication/metalink4+xmlâ€
     available.  Specify 0 or â€˜infâ€™ to choose the first good one.
     Metaurls, such as those from a â€˜--metalink-over-httpâ€™, may have
     been sorted by priority keyâ€™s value; keep this in mind to choose
     the right NUMBER.

â€˜--preferred-locationâ€™
     Set preferred location for Metalink resources.  This has effect if
     multiple resources with same priority are available.

â€˜--xattrâ€™
     Enable use of file systemâ€™s extended attributes to save the
     original URL and the Referer HTTP header value if used.

     Be aware that the URL might contain private information like access
     tokens or credentials.

â€˜-Fâ€™
â€˜--force-htmlâ€™
     When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an HTML
     file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from existing
     HTML files on your local disk, by adding â€˜<base href="URL">â€™ to
     HTML, or using the â€˜--baseâ€™ command-line option.

â€˜-B URLâ€™
â€˜--base=URLâ€™
     Resolves relative links using URL as the point of reference, when
     reading links from an HTML file specified via the
     â€˜-iâ€™/â€˜--input-fileâ€™ option (together with â€˜--force-htmlâ€™, or when
     the input file was fetched remotely from a server describing it as
     HTML).  This is equivalent to the presence of a â€˜BASEâ€™ tag in the
     HTML input file, with URL as the value for the â€˜hrefâ€™ attribute.

     For instance, if you specify â€˜http://foo/bar/a.htmlâ€™ for URL, and
     Wget reads â€˜../baz/b.htmlâ€™ from the input file, it would be
     resolved to â€˜http://foo/baz/b.htmlâ€™.

â€˜--config=FILEâ€™
     Specify the location of a startup file you wish to use instead of
     the default one(s).  Use â€“no-config to disable reading of config
     files.  If both â€“config and â€“no-config are given, â€“no-config is
     ignored.

â€˜--rejected-log=LOGFILEâ€™
     Logs all URL rejections to LOGFILE as comma separated values.  The
     values include the reason of rejection, the URL and the parent URL
     it was found in.

2.5 Download Options
====================

â€˜--bind-address=ADDRESSâ€™
     When making client TCP/IP connections, bind to ADDRESS on the local
     machine.  ADDRESS may be specified as a hostname or IP address.
     This option can be useful if your machine is bound to multiple IPs.

â€˜--bind-dns-address=ADDRESSâ€™
     [libcares only] This address overrides the route for DNS requests.
     If you ever need to circumvent the standard settings from
     /etc/resolv.conf, this option together with â€˜--dns-serversâ€™ is your
     friend.  ADDRESS must be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 address.
     Wget needs to be built with libcares for this option to be
     available.

â€˜--dns-servers=ADDRESSESâ€™
     [libcares only] The given address(es) override the standard
     nameserver addresses, e.g.  as configured in /etc/resolv.conf.
     ADDRESSES may be specified either as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses,
     comma-separated.  Wget needs to be built with libcares for this
     option to be available.

â€˜-t NUMBERâ€™
â€˜--tries=NUMBERâ€™
     Set number of tries to NUMBER.  Specify 0 or â€˜infâ€™ for infinite
     retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the exception of
     fatal errors like â€œconnection refusedâ€ or â€œnot foundâ€ (404), which
     are not retried.

â€˜-O FILEâ€™
â€˜--output-document=FILEâ€™
     The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all
     will be concatenated together and written to FILE.  If â€˜-â€™ is used
     as FILE, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling
     link conversion.  (Use â€˜./-â€™ to print to a file literally named
     â€˜-â€™.)

     Use of â€˜-Oâ€™ is _not_ intended to mean simply â€œuse the name FILE
     instead of the one in the URL;â€ rather, it is analogous to shell
     redirection: â€˜wget -O file http://fooâ€™ is intended to work like
     â€˜wget -O - http://foo > fileâ€™; â€˜fileâ€™ will be truncated
     immediately, and _all_ downloaded content will be written there.

     For this reason, â€˜-Nâ€™ (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in
     combination with â€˜-Oâ€™: since FILE is always newly created, it will
     always have a very new timestamp.  A warning will be issued if this
     combination is used.

     Similarly, using â€˜-râ€™ or â€˜-pâ€™ with â€˜-Oâ€™ may not work as you expect:
     Wget wonâ€™t just download the first file to FILE and then download
     the rest to their normal names: _all_ downloaded content will be
     placed in FILE.  This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been
     reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases
     where this behavior can actually have some use.

     A combination with â€˜-ncâ€™ is only accepted if the given output file
     does not exist.

     Note that a combination with â€˜-kâ€™ is only permitted when
     downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert
     all relative URIs to external ones; â€˜-kâ€™ makes no sense for
     multiple URIs when theyâ€™re all being downloaded to a single file;
     â€˜-kâ€™ can be used only when the output is a regular file.

â€˜-ncâ€™
â€˜--no-clobberâ€™
     If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
     Wgetâ€™s behavior depends on a few options, including â€˜-ncâ€™.  In
     certain cases, the local file will be â€œclobberedâ€, or overwritten,
     upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.

     When running Wget without â€˜-Nâ€™, â€˜-ncâ€™, â€˜-râ€™, or â€˜-pâ€™, downloading
     the same file in the same directory will result in the original
     copy of FILE being preserved and the second copy being named
     â€˜FILE.1â€™.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy
     will be named â€˜FILE.2â€™, and so on.  (This is also the behavior with
     â€˜-ndâ€™, even if â€˜-râ€™ or â€˜-pâ€™ are in effect.)  When â€˜-ncâ€™ is
     specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to
     download newer copies of â€˜FILEâ€™.  Therefore, â€œâ€˜no-clobberâ€™â€ is
     actually a misnomer in this modeâ€”itâ€™s not clobbering thatâ€™s
     prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already preventing
     clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving thatâ€™s
     prevented.

     When running Wget with â€˜-râ€™ or â€˜-pâ€™, but without â€˜-Nâ€™, â€˜-ndâ€™, or
     â€˜-ncâ€™, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
     overwriting the old.  Adding â€˜-ncâ€™ will prevent this behavior,
     instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer
     copies on the server to be ignored.

     When running Wget with â€˜-Nâ€™, with or without â€˜-râ€™ or â€˜-pâ€™, the
     decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file
     depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file
     (*note Time-Stamping::).  â€˜-ncâ€™ may not be specified at the same
     time as â€˜-Nâ€™.

     A combination with â€˜-Oâ€™/â€˜--output-documentâ€™ is only accepted if the
     given output file does not exist.

     Note that when â€˜-ncâ€™ is specified, files with the suffixes â€˜.htmlâ€™
     or â€˜.htmâ€™ will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they
     had been retrieved from the Web.

â€˜--backups=BACKUPSâ€™
     Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by adding a
     â€˜.1â€™ suffix (â€˜_1â€™ on VMS) to the file name.  Such backup files are
     rotated to â€˜.2â€™, â€˜.3â€™, and so on, up to BACKUPS (and lost beyond
     that).

â€˜--no-netrcâ€™
     Do not try to obtain credentials from â€˜.netrcâ€™ file.  By default
     â€˜.netrcâ€™ file is searched for credentials in case none have been
     passed on command line and authentication is required.

â€˜-câ€™
â€˜--continueâ€™
     Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
     you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
     Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

          wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

     If there is a file named â€˜ls-lR.Zâ€™ in the current directory, Wget
     will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and
     will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal
     to the length of the local file.

     Note that you donâ€™t need to specify this option if you just want
     the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should
     the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default
     behavior.  â€˜-câ€™ only affects resumption of downloads started
     _prior_ to this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still
     sitting around.

     Without â€˜-câ€™, the previous example would just download the remote
     file to â€˜ls-lR.Z.1â€™, leaving the truncated â€˜ls-lR.Zâ€™ file alone.

     If you use â€˜-câ€™ on a non-empty file, and the server does not
     support continued downloading, Wget will restart the download from
     scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely.

     Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use â€˜-câ€™ on a file which is of
     equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download
     the file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when
     the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because
     it was changed on the server since your last download
     attempt)â€”because â€œcontinuingâ€ is not meaningful, no download
     occurs.

     On the other side of the coin, while using â€˜-câ€™, any file thatâ€™s
     bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
     download and only â€˜(length(remote) - length(local))â€™ bytes will be
     downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This
     behavior can be desirable in certain casesâ€”for instance, you can
     use â€˜wget -câ€™ to download just the new portion thatâ€™s been appended
     to a data collection or log file.

     However, if the file is bigger on the server because itâ€™s been
     _changed_, as opposed to just _appended_ to, youâ€™ll end up with a
     garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is
     really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be
     especially careful of this when using â€˜-câ€™ in conjunction with
     â€˜-râ€™, since every file will be considered as an "incomplete
     download" candidate.

     Another instance where youâ€™ll get a garbled file if you try to use
     â€˜-câ€™ is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a â€œtransfer
     interruptedâ€ string into the local file.  In the future a
     â€œrollbackâ€ option may be added to deal with this case.

     Note that â€˜-câ€™ only works with FTP servers and with HTTP servers
     that support the â€˜Rangeâ€™ header.

â€˜--start-pos=OFFSETâ€™
     Start downloading at zero-based position OFFSET.  Offset may be
     expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the â€˜kâ€™ suffix, or megabytes
     with the â€˜mâ€™ suffix, etc.

     â€˜--start-posâ€™ has higher precedence over â€˜--continueâ€™.  When
     â€˜--start-posâ€™ and â€˜--continueâ€™ are both specified, wget will emit a
     warning then proceed as if â€˜--continueâ€™ was absent.

     Server support for continued download is required, otherwise
     â€˜--start-posâ€™ cannot help.  See â€˜-câ€™ for details.

â€˜--progress=TYPEâ€™
     Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
     indicators are â€œdotâ€ and â€œbarâ€.

     The â€œbarâ€ indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII progress
     bar graphics (a.k.a â€œthermometerâ€ display) indicating the status of
     retrieval.  If the output is not a TTY, the â€œdotâ€ bar will be used
     by default.

     Use â€˜--progress=dotâ€™ to switch to the â€œdotâ€ display.  It traces the
     retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
     fixed amount of downloaded data.

     The progress TYPE can also take one or more parameters.  The
     parameters vary based on the TYPE selected.  Parameters to TYPE are
     passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon (:) like
     this: â€˜--progress=TYPE:PARAMETER1:PARAMETER2â€™.

     When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the â€œstyleâ€ by
     specifying the type as â€˜dot:STYLEâ€™.  Different styles assign
     different meaning to one dot.  With the â€˜defaultâ€™ style each dot
     represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a
     line.  The â€˜binaryâ€™ style has a more â€œcomputerâ€-like orientationâ€”8K
     dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K
     lines).  The â€˜megaâ€™ style is suitable for downloading large
     filesâ€”each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a
     cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M). If
     â€˜megaâ€™ is not enough then you can use the â€˜gigaâ€™ styleâ€”each dot
     represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32
     dots on each line (so each line contains 32M).

     With â€˜--progress=barâ€™, there are currently two possible parameters,
     FORCE and NOSCROLL.

     When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls back to
     â€œdotâ€, even if â€˜--progress=barâ€™ was passed to Wget during
     invocation.  This behaviour can be overridden and the â€œbarâ€ output
     forced by using the â€œforceâ€ parameter as â€˜--progress=bar:forceâ€™.

     By default, the â€˜barâ€™ style progress bar scroll the name of the
     file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the
     filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.  In
     certain cases, such as with â€˜--progress=bar:forceâ€™, one may not
     want the scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By passing the
     â€œnoscrollâ€ parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the
     filename as possible without scrolling through it.

     Note that you can set the default style using the â€˜progressâ€™
     command in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.  That setting may be overridden from the
     command line.  For example, to force the bar output without
     scrolling, use â€˜--progress=bar:force:noscrollâ€™.

â€˜--show-progressâ€™
     Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.

     By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose mode.
     One may however, want wget to display the progress bar on screen in
     conjunction with any other verbosity modes like â€˜--no-verboseâ€™ or
     â€˜--quietâ€™.  This is often a desired a property when invoking wget
     to download several small/large files.  In such a case, wget could
     simply be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output
     on the screen.

     This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
     â€˜stderrâ€™ when used alongside the â€˜--output-fileâ€™ option.

â€˜-Nâ€™
â€˜--timestampingâ€™
     Turn on time-stamping.  *Note Time-Stamping::, for details.

â€˜--no-if-modified-sinceâ€™
     Do not send If-Modified-Since header in â€˜-Nâ€™ mode.  Send
     preliminary HEAD request instead.  This has only effect in â€˜-Nâ€™
     mode.

â€˜--no-use-server-timestampsâ€™
     Donâ€™t set the local fileâ€™s timestamp by the one on the server.

     By default, when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set to
     match those from the remote file.  This allows the use of
     â€˜--timestampingâ€™ on subsequent invocations of wget.  However, it is
     sometimes useful to base the local fileâ€™s timestamp on when it was
     actually downloaded; for that purpose, the
     â€˜--no-use-server-timestampsâ€™ option has been provided.

â€˜-Sâ€™
â€˜--server-responseâ€™
     Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP
     servers.

â€˜--spiderâ€™
     When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web â€œspiderâ€,
     which means that it will not download the pages, just check that
     they are there.  For example, you can use Wget to check your
     bookmarks:

          wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

     This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the
     functionality of real web spiders.

â€˜-T secondsâ€™
â€˜--timeout=SECONDSâ€™
     Set the network timeout to SECONDS seconds.  This is equivalent to
     specifying â€˜--dns-timeoutâ€™, â€˜--connect-timeoutâ€™, and
     â€˜--read-timeoutâ€™, all at the same time.

     When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and
     abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies
     like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled
     by default is a 900-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0
     disables it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is
     best not to change the default timeout settings.

     All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
     subsecond values.  For example, â€˜0.1â€™ seconds is a legal (though
     unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for
     checking server response times or for testing network latency.

â€˜--dns-timeout=SECONDSâ€™
     Set the DNS lookup timeout to SECONDS seconds.  DNS lookups that
     donâ€™t complete within the specified time will fail.  By default,
     there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that implemented by
     system libraries.

â€˜--connect-timeout=SECONDSâ€™
     Set the connect timeout to SECONDS seconds.  TCP connections that
     take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default, there is no
     connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.

â€˜--read-timeout=SECONDSâ€™
     Set the read (and write) timeout to SECONDS seconds.  The â€œtimeâ€ of
     this timeout refers to â€œidle timeâ€: if, at any point in the
     download, no data is received for more than the specified number of
     seconds, reading fails and the download is restarted.  This option
     does not directly affect the duration of the entire download.

     Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the connection
     sooner than this option requires.  The default read timeout is 900
     seconds.

â€˜--limit-rate=AMOUNTâ€™
     Limit the download speed to AMOUNT bytes per second.  Amount may be
     expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the â€˜kâ€™ suffix, or megabytes
     with the â€˜mâ€™ suffix.  For example, â€˜--limit-rate=20kâ€™ will limit
     the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful when, for whatever
     reason, you donâ€™t want Wget to consume the entire available
     bandwidth.

     This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in
     conjunction with power suffixes; for example, â€˜--limit-rate=2.5kâ€™
     is a legal value.

     Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
     amount of time after a network read that took less time than
     specified by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the TCP
     transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate.
     However, it may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so
     donâ€™t be surprised if limiting the rate doesnâ€™t work well with very
     small files.

â€˜-w SECONDSâ€™
â€˜--wait=SECONDSâ€™
     Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use
     of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by
     making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time
     can be specified in minutes using the â€˜mâ€™ suffix, in hours using
     â€˜hâ€™ suffix, or in days using â€˜dâ€™ suffix.

     Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network
     or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough
     to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the
     retry.  The waiting interval specified by this function is
     influenced by â€˜--random-waitâ€™, which see.

â€˜--waitretry=SECONDSâ€™
     If you donâ€™t want Wget to wait between _every_ retrieval, but only
     between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.  Wget
     will use â€œlinear backoffâ€, waiting 1 second after the first failure
     on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds after the second failure on
     that file, up to the maximum number of SECONDS you specify.

     By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.

â€˜--random-waitâ€™
     Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval
     programs such as Wget by looking for statistically significant
     similarities in the time between requests.  This option causes the
     time between requests to vary between 0.5 and 1.5 * WAIT seconds,
     where WAIT was specified using the â€˜--waitâ€™ option, in order to
     mask Wgetâ€™s presence from such analysis.

     A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
     consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the
     fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to
     ensure automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing
     DHCP-supplied addresses.

     The â€˜--random-waitâ€™ option was inspired by this ill-advised
     recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to
     the actions of one.

â€˜--no-proxyâ€™
     Donâ€™t use proxies, even if the appropriate â€˜*_proxyâ€™ environment
     variable is defined.

     *Note Proxies::, for more information about the use of proxies with
     Wget.

â€˜-Q QUOTAâ€™
â€˜--quota=QUOTAâ€™
     Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
     specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with â€˜kâ€™ suffix), or
     megabytes (with â€˜mâ€™ suffix).

     Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if
     you specify â€˜wget -Q10k https://example.com/ls-lR.gzâ€™, all of the
     â€˜ls-lR.gzâ€™ will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several
     URLs are specified on the command-line.  The quota is checked only
     at the end of each downloaded file, so it will never result in a
     partially downloaded file.  Thus you may safely type â€˜wget -Q2m -i
     sitesâ€™â€”download will be aborted after the file that exhausts the
     quota is completely downloaded.

     Setting quota to 0 or to â€˜infâ€™ unlimits the download quota.

â€˜--no-dns-cacheâ€™
     Turn off caching of DNS lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the IP
     addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesnâ€™t have to repeatedly
     contact the DNS server for the same (typically small) set of hosts
     it retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget
     run will contact DNS again.

     However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not
     desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
     short-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues
     a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to â€˜gethostbynameâ€™ or
     â€˜getaddrinfoâ€™) each time it makes a new connection.  Please note
     that this option will _not_ affect caching that might be performed
     by the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such as
     NSCD.

     If you donâ€™t understand exactly what this option does, you probably
     wonâ€™t need it.

â€˜--restrict-file-names=MODESâ€™
     Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during
     generation of local filenames.  Characters that are â€œrestrictedâ€ by
     this option are escaped, i.e.  replaced with â€˜%HHâ€™, where â€˜HHâ€™ is
     the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted
     character.  This option may also be used to force all alphabetical
     cases to be either lower- or uppercase.

     By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe
     as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control
     characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful
     for changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to
     a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of
     the control characters, or you want to further restrict characters
     to only those in the ASCII range of values.

     The MODES are a comma-separated set of text values.  The acceptable
     values are â€˜unixâ€™, â€˜windowsâ€™, â€˜nocontrolâ€™, â€˜asciiâ€™, â€˜lowercaseâ€™,
     and â€˜uppercaseâ€™.  The values â€˜unixâ€™ and â€˜windowsâ€™ are mutually
     exclusive (one will override the other), as are â€˜lowercaseâ€™ and
     â€˜uppercaseâ€™.  Those last are special cases, as they do not change
     the set of characters that would be escaped, but rather force local
     file paths to be converted either to lower- or uppercase.

     When â€œunixâ€ is specified, Wget escapes the character â€˜/â€™ and the
     control characters in the ranges 0â€“31 and 128â€“159.  This is the
     default on Unix-like operating systems.

     When â€œwindowsâ€ is given, Wget escapes the characters â€˜\â€™, â€˜|â€™, â€˜/â€™,
     â€˜:â€™, â€˜?â€™, â€˜"â€™, â€˜*â€™, â€˜<â€™, â€˜>â€™, and the control characters in the
     ranges 0â€“31 and 128â€“159.  In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode
     uses â€˜+â€™ instead of â€˜:â€™ to separate host and port in local file
     names, and uses â€˜@â€™ instead of â€˜?â€™ to separate the query portion of
     the file name from the rest.  Therefore, a URL that would be saved
     as â€˜www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blahâ€™ in Unix mode would be
     saved as â€˜www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blahâ€™ in Windows
     mode.  This mode is the default on Windows.

     If you specify â€˜nocontrolâ€™, then the escaping of the control
     characters is also switched off.  This option may make sense when
     you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8 characters, on a
     system which can save and display filenames in UTF-8 (some possible
     byte values used in UTF-8 byte sequences fall in the range of
     values designated by Wget as â€œcontrolsâ€).

     The â€˜asciiâ€™ mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are
     outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater than 127)
     shall be escaped.  This can be useful when saving filenames whose
     encoding does not match the one used locally.

â€˜-4â€™
â€˜--inet4-onlyâ€™
â€˜-6â€™
â€˜--inet6-onlyâ€™
     Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With â€˜--inet4-onlyâ€™ or
     â€˜-4â€™, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts, ignoring AAAA records
     in DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6 addresses specified in
     URLs.  Conversely, with â€˜--inet6-onlyâ€™ or â€˜-6â€™, Wget will only
     connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses.

     Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an
     IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the hostâ€™s
     DNS record.  If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
     Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it can connect
     to.  (Also see â€˜--prefer-familyâ€™ option described below.)

     These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or
     IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid
     debugging or to deal with broken network configuration.  Only one
     of â€˜--inet6-onlyâ€™ and â€˜--inet4-onlyâ€™ may be specified at the same
     time.  Neither option is available in Wget compiled without IPv6
     support.

â€˜--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6â€™
     When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the addresses
     with specified address family first.  The address order returned by
     DNS is used without change by default.

     This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when accessing
     hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses from IPv4
     networks.  For example, â€˜www.kame.netâ€™ resolves to
     â€˜2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085â€™ and to â€˜203.178.141.194â€™.
     When the preferred family is â€˜IPv4â€™, the IPv4 address is used
     first; when the preferred family is â€˜IPv6â€™, the IPv6 address is
     used first; if the specified value is â€˜noneâ€™, the address order
     returned by DNS is used without change.

     Unlike â€˜-4â€™ and â€˜-6â€™, this option doesnâ€™t inhibit access to any
     address family, it only changes the _order_ in which the addresses
     are accessed.  Also note that the reordering performed by this
     option is â€œstableâ€â€”it doesnâ€™t affect order of addresses of the same
     family.  That is, the relative order of all IPv4 addresses and of
     all IPv6 addresses remains intact in all cases.

â€˜--retry-connrefusedâ€™
     Consider â€œconnection refusedâ€ a transient error and try again.
     Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to connect to the
     site because failure to connect is taken as a sign that the server
     is not running at all and that retries would not help.  This option
     is for mirroring unreliable sites whose servers tend to disappear
     for short periods of time.

â€˜--user=USERâ€™
â€˜--password=PASSWORDâ€™
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD for both FTP and
     HTTP file retrieval.  These parameters can be overridden using the
     â€˜--ftp-userâ€™ and â€˜--ftp-passwordâ€™ options for FTP connections and
     the â€˜--http-userâ€™ and â€˜--http-passwordâ€™ options for HTTP
     connections.

â€˜--ask-passwordâ€™
     Prompt for a password for each connection established.  Cannot be
     specified when â€˜--passwordâ€™ is being used, because they are
     mutually exclusive.

â€˜--use-askpass=COMMANDâ€™
     Prompt for a user and password using the specified command.  If no
     command is specified then the command in the environment variable
     WGET_ASKPASS is used.  If WGET_ASKPASS is not set then the command
     in the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS is used.

     You can set the default command for use-askpass in the â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.
     That setting may be overridden from the command line.

â€˜--no-iriâ€™

     Turn off internationalized URI (IRI) support.  Use â€˜--iriâ€™ to turn
     it on.  IRI support is activated by default.

     You can set the default state of IRI support using the â€˜iriâ€™
     command in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.  That setting may be overridden from the
     command line.

â€˜--local-encoding=ENCODINGâ€™

     Force Wget to use ENCODING as the default system encoding.  That
     affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments from locale
     to UTF-8 for IRI support.

     Wget use the function â€˜nl_langinfo()â€™ and then the â€˜CHARSETâ€™
     environment variable to get the locale.  If it fails, ASCII is
     used.

     You can set the default local encoding using the â€˜local_encodingâ€™
     command in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.  That setting may be overridden from the
     command line.

â€˜--remote-encoding=ENCODINGâ€™

     Force Wget to use ENCODING as the default remote server encoding.
     That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files from remote
     encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch.  This options is only
     useful for IRI support, for the interpretation of non-ASCII
     characters.

     For HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP â€˜Content-Typeâ€™
     header and in HTML â€˜Content-Type http-equivâ€™ meta tag.

     You can set the default encoding using the â€˜remoteencodingâ€™ command
     in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.  That setting may be overridden from the command
     line.

â€˜--unlinkâ€™

     Force Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing file.
     This option is useful for downloading to the directory with
     hardlinks.

2.6 Directory Options
=====================

â€˜-ndâ€™
â€˜--no-directoriesâ€™
     Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
     recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get saved
     to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name shows up
     more than once, the filenames will get extensions â€˜.nâ€™).

â€˜-xâ€™
â€˜--force-directoriesâ€™
     The opposite of â€˜-ndâ€™â€”create a hierarchy of directories, even if
     one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g.  â€˜wget -x
     http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txtâ€™ will save the downloaded file to
     â€˜fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txtâ€™.

â€˜-nHâ€™
â€˜--no-host-directoriesâ€™
     Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
     invoking Wget with â€˜-r http://fly.srk.fer.hr/â€™ will create a
     structure of directories beginning with â€˜fly.srk.fer.hr/â€™.  This
     option disables such behavior.

â€˜--protocol-directoriesâ€™
     Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file names.
     For example, with this option, â€˜wget -r http://HOSTâ€™ will save to
     â€˜http/HOST/...â€™ rather than just to â€˜HOST/...â€™.

â€˜--cut-dirs=NUMBERâ€™
     Ignore NUMBER directory components.  This is useful for getting a
     fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval
     will be saved.

     Take, for example, the directory at
     â€˜ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/â€™.  If you retrieve it with â€˜-râ€™,
     it will be saved locally under â€˜ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/â€™.  While
     the â€˜-nHâ€™ option can remove the â€˜ftp.xemacs.org/â€™ part, you are
     still stuck with â€˜pub/xemacsâ€™.  This is where â€˜--cut-dirsâ€™ comes in
     handy; it makes Wget not â€œseeâ€ NUMBER remote directory components.
     Here are several examples of how â€˜--cut-dirsâ€™ option works.

          No options        -> ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
          -nH               -> pub/xemacs/
          -nH --cut-dirs=1  -> xemacs/
          -nH --cut-dirs=2  -> .

          --cut-dirs=1      -> ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
          ...

     If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this option
     is similar to a combination of â€˜-ndâ€™ and â€˜-Pâ€™.  However, unlike
     â€˜-ndâ€™, â€˜--cut-dirsâ€™ does not lose with subdirectoriesâ€”for instance,
     with â€˜-nH --cut-dirs=1â€™, a â€˜beta/â€™ subdirectory will be placed to
     â€˜xemacs/betaâ€™, as one would expect.

â€˜-P PREFIXâ€™
â€˜--directory-prefix=PREFIXâ€™
     Set directory prefix to PREFIX.  The â€œdirectory prefixâ€ is the
     directory where all other files and subdirectories will be saved
     to, i.e.  the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is â€˜.â€™ (the
     current directory).

2.7 HTTP Options
================

â€˜--default-page=NAMEâ€™
     Use NAME as the default file name when it isnâ€™t known (i.e., for
     URLs that end in a slash), instead of â€˜index.htmlâ€™.

â€˜-Eâ€™
â€˜--adjust-extensionâ€™
     If a file of type â€˜application/xhtml+xmlâ€™ or â€˜text/htmlâ€™ is
     downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp
     â€˜\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?â€™, this option will cause the suffix â€˜.htmlâ€™ to
     be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for instance,
     when youâ€™re mirroring a remote site that uses â€˜.aspâ€™ pages, but you
     want the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server.
     Another good use for this is when youâ€™re downloading CGI-generated
     materials.  A URL like â€˜http://site.com/article.cgi?25â€™ will be
     saved as â€˜article.cgi?25.htmlâ€™.

     Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every
     time you re-mirror a site, because Wget canâ€™t tell that the local
     â€˜X.htmlâ€™ file corresponds to remote URL â€˜Xâ€™ (since it doesnâ€™t yet
     know that the URL produces output of type â€˜text/htmlâ€™ or
     â€˜application/xhtml+xmlâ€™.

     As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files
     of type â€˜text/cssâ€™ end in the suffix â€˜.cssâ€™, and the option was
     renamed from â€˜--html-extensionâ€™, to better reflect its new
     behavior.  The old option name is still acceptable, but should now
     be considered deprecated.

     As of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded
     files with a â€˜Content-Encodingâ€™ of â€˜brâ€™, â€˜compressâ€™, â€˜deflateâ€™ or
     â€˜gzipâ€™ end in the suffix â€˜.brâ€™, â€˜.Zâ€™, â€˜.zlibâ€™ and â€˜.gzâ€™
     respectively.

     At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded to
     include suffixes for other types of content, including content
     types that are not parsed by Wget.

â€˜--http-user=USERâ€™
â€˜--http-password=PASSWORDâ€™
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD on an HTTP server.
     According to the type of the challenge, Wget will encode them using
     either the â€˜basicâ€™ (insecure), the â€˜digestâ€™, or the Windows â€˜NTLMâ€™
     authentication scheme.

     Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
     (*note URL Format::).  Either method reveals your password to
     anyone who bothers to run â€˜psâ€™.  To prevent the passwords from
     being seen, use the â€˜--use-askpassâ€™ or store them in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ or
     â€˜.netrcâ€™, and make sure to protect those files from other users
     with â€˜chmodâ€™.  If the passwords are really important, do not leave
     them lying in those files eitherâ€”edit the files and delete them
     after Wget has started the download.

â€˜--no-http-keep-aliveâ€™
     Turn off the â€œkeep-aliveâ€ feature for HTTP downloads.  Normally,
     Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you
     download more than one document from the same server, they get
     transferred over the same TCP connection.  This saves time and at
     the same time reduces the load on the server.

     This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent
     (keep-alive) connections donâ€™t work for you, for example due to a
     server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope
     with the connections.

â€˜--no-cacheâ€™
     Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the remote
     server appropriate directives (â€˜Cache-Control: no-cacheâ€™ and
     â€˜Pragma: no-cacheâ€™) to get the file from the remote service, rather
     than returning the cached version.  This is especially useful for
     retrieving and flushing out-of-date documents on proxy servers.

     Caching is allowed by default.

â€˜--no-cookiesâ€™
     Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for
     maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a
     cookie using the â€˜Set-Cookieâ€™ header, and the client responds with
     the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the
     server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange
     this information, some consider them a breach of privacy.  The
     default is to use cookies; however, _storing_ cookies is not on by
     default.

â€˜--load-cookies FILEâ€™
     Load cookies from FILE before the first HTTP retrieval.  FILE is a
     textual file in the format originally used by Netscapeâ€™s
     â€˜cookies.txtâ€™ file.

     You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
     require that you be logged in to access some or all of their
     content.  The login process typically works by the web server
     issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
     credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when
     accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

     Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your
     browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved
     by â€˜--load-cookiesâ€™â€”simply point Wget to the location of the
     â€˜cookies.txtâ€™ file, and it will send the same cookies your browser
     would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
     cookie files in different locations:

     Netscape 4.x.
          The cookies are in â€˜~/.netscape/cookies.txtâ€™.

     Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.
          Mozillaâ€™s cookie file is also named â€˜cookies.txtâ€™, located
          somewhere under â€˜~/.mozillaâ€™, in the directory of your
          profile.  The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like
          â€˜~/.mozilla/default/SOME-WEIRD-STRING/cookies.txtâ€™.

     Internet Explorer.
          You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File
          menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been tested
          with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with
          earlier versions.

     Other browsers.
          If you are using a different browser to create your cookies,
          â€˜--load-cookiesâ€™ will only work if you can locate or produce a
          cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects.

     If you cannot use â€˜--load-cookiesâ€™, there might still be an
     alternative.  If your browser supports a â€œcookie managerâ€, you can
     use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site youâ€™re
     mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the cookie, and
     manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the
     â€œofficialâ€ cookie support:

          wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: NAME=VALUE"

â€˜--save-cookies FILEâ€™
     Save cookies to FILE before exiting.  This will not save cookies
     that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-called â€œsession
     cookiesâ€), but also see â€˜--keep-session-cookiesâ€™.

â€˜--keep-session-cookiesâ€™
     When specified, causes â€˜--save-cookiesâ€™ to also save session
     cookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they are
     meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser.
     Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to
     visit the home page before you can access some pages.  With this
     option, multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session
     as far as the site is concerned.

     Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session
     cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wgetâ€™s
     â€˜--load-cookiesâ€™ recognizes those as session cookies, but it might
     confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be
     treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want
     â€˜--save-cookiesâ€™ to preserve them again, you must use
     â€˜--keep-session-cookiesâ€™ again.

â€˜--ignore-lengthâ€™
     Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more precise)
     send out bogus â€˜Content-Lengthâ€™ headers, which makes Wget go wild,
     as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot this
     syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again,
     each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has
     closed on the very same byte.

     With this option, Wget will ignore the â€˜Content-Lengthâ€™ headerâ€”as
     if it never existed.

â€˜--header=HEADER-LINEâ€™
     Send HEADER-LINE along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP
     request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means it must
     contain name and value separated by colon, and must not contain
     newlines.

     You may define more than one additional header by specifying
     â€˜--headerâ€™ more than once.

          wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
               --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

     Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all
     previous user-defined headers.

     As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers
     otherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to
     connect to localhost, but to specify â€˜foo.barâ€™ in the â€˜Hostâ€™
     header:

          wget --header="Host: foo.bar" http://localhost/

     In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of â€˜--headerâ€™ caused
     sending of duplicate headers.

â€˜--compression=TYPEâ€™
     Choose the type of compression to be used.  Legal values are
     â€˜autoâ€™, â€˜gzipâ€™ and â€˜noneâ€™.

     If â€˜autoâ€™ or â€˜gzipâ€™ are specified, Wget asks the server to compress
     the file using the gzip compression format.  If the server
     compresses the file and responds with the â€˜Content-Encodingâ€™ header
     field set appropriately, the file will be decompressed
     automatically.

     If â€˜noneâ€™ is specified, wget will not ask the server to compress
     the file and will not decompress any server responses.  This is the
     default.

     Compression support is currently experimental.  In case it is
     turned on, please report any bugs to â€˜bug-wget@gnu.orgâ€™.

â€˜--max-redirect=NUMBERâ€™
     Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a
     resource.  The default is 20, which is usually far more than
     necessary.  However, on those occasions where you want to allow
     more (or fewer), this is the option to use.

â€˜--proxy-user=USERâ€™
â€˜--proxy-password=PASSWORDâ€™
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD for authentication
     on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them using the â€˜basicâ€™
     authentication scheme.

     Security considerations similar to those with â€˜--http-passwordâ€™
     pertain here as well.

â€˜--referer=URLâ€™
     Include â€˜Referer: URLâ€™ header in HTTP request.  Useful for
     retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume they
     are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers and only
     come out properly when Referer is set to one of the pages that
     point to them.

â€˜--save-headersâ€™
     Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file, preceding the
     actual contents, with an empty line as the separator.

â€˜-U AGENT-STRINGâ€™
â€˜--user-agent=AGENT-STRINGâ€™
     Identify as AGENT-STRING to the HTTP server.

     The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a
     â€˜User-Agentâ€™ header field.  This enables distinguishing the WWW
     software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of
     protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as â€˜Wget/VERSIONâ€™,
     VERSION being the current version number of Wget.

     However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
     tailoring the output according to the â€˜User-Agentâ€™-supplied
     information.  While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has
     been abused by servers denying information to clients other than
     (historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet
     Explorer.  This option allows you to change the â€˜User-Agentâ€™ line
     issued by Wget.  Use of this option is discouraged, unless you
     really know what you are doing.

     Specifying empty user agent with â€˜--user-agent=""â€™ instructs Wget
     not to send the â€˜User-Agentâ€™ header in HTTP requests.

â€˜--post-data=STRINGâ€™
â€˜--post-file=FILEâ€™
     Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the specified
     data in the request body.  â€˜--post-dataâ€™ sends STRING as data,
     whereas â€˜--post-fileâ€™ sends the contents of FILE.  Other than that,
     they work in exactly the same way.  In particular, they _both_
     expect content of the form â€˜key1=value1&key2=value2â€™, with
     percent-encoding for special characters; the only difference is
     that one expects its content as a command-line parameter and the
     other accepts its content from a file.  In particular,
     â€˜--post-fileâ€™ is _not_ for transmitting files as form attachments:
     those must appear as â€˜key=valueâ€™ data (with appropriate
     percent-coding) just like everything else.  Wget does not currently
     support â€˜multipart/form-dataâ€™ for transmitting POST data; only
     â€˜application/x-www-form-urlencodedâ€™.  Only one of â€˜--post-dataâ€™ and
     â€˜--post-fileâ€™ should be specified.

     Please note that wget does not require the content to be of the
     form â€˜key1=value1&key2=value2â€™, and neither does it test for it.
     Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to it.  Most
     servers however expect the POST data to be in the above format when
     processing HTML Forms.

     When sending a POST request using the â€˜--post-fileâ€™ option, Wget
     treats the file as a binary file and will send every character in
     the POST request without stripping trailing newline or formfeed
     characters.  Any other control characters in the text will also be
     sent as-is in the POST request.

     Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST data
     in advance.  Therefore the argument to â€˜--post-fileâ€™ must be a
     regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like â€˜/dev/stdinâ€™
     wonâ€™t work.  Itâ€™s not quite clear how to work around this
     limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0.  Although HTTP/1.1 introduces
     â€œchunkedâ€ transfer that doesnâ€™t require knowing the request length
     in advance, a client canâ€™t use chunked unless it knows itâ€™s talking
     to an HTTP/1.1 server.  And it canâ€™t know that until it receives a
     response, which in turn requires the request to have been completed
     â€“ a chicken-and-egg problem.

     Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST
     request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the response
     code returned by the server.  In case of a 301 Moved Permanently,
     302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in
     accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a POST request.  In case
     a server wants the client to change the Request method upon
     redirection, it should send a 303 See Other response code.

     This example shows how to log in to a server using POST and then
     proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible
     to authorized users:

          # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
          wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
               --post-data 'user=foo&password=bar' \
               http://example.com/auth.php

          # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
          wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
               -p http://example.com/interesting/article.php

     If the server is using session cookies to track user
     authentication, the above will not work because â€˜--save-cookiesâ€™
     will not save them (and neither will browsers) and the
     â€˜cookies.txtâ€™ file will be empty.  In that case use
     â€˜--keep-session-cookiesâ€™ along with â€˜--save-cookiesâ€™ to force
     saving of session cookies.

â€˜--method=HTTP-METHODâ€™
     For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of other
     HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly set them using
     â€˜--header=Header-Lineâ€™.  Wget will use whatever string is passed to
     it after â€˜--methodâ€™ as the HTTP Method to the server.

â€˜--body-data=DATA-STRINGâ€™
â€˜--body-file=DATA-FILEâ€™
     Must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the server
     along with the Method specified using â€˜--methodâ€™.  â€˜--body-dataâ€™
     sends STRING as data, whereas â€˜--body-fileâ€™ sends the contents of
     FILE.  Other than that, they work in exactly the same way.

     Currently, â€˜--body-fileâ€™ is _not_ for transmitting files as a
     whole.  Wget does not currently support â€˜multipart/form-dataâ€™ for
     transmitting data; only â€˜application/x-www-form-urlencodedâ€™.  In
     the future, this may be changed so that wget sends the
     â€˜--body-fileâ€™ as a complete file instead of sending its contents to
     the server.  Please be aware that Wget needs to know the contents
     of BODY Data in advance, and hence the argument to â€˜--body-fileâ€™
     should be a regular file.  See â€˜--post-fileâ€™ for a more detailed
     explanation.  Only one of â€˜--body-dataâ€™ and â€˜--body-fileâ€™ should be
     specified.

     If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget will
     suspend the current method and send a GET request till the
     redirection is completed.  This is true for all redirection
     response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect which is used to
     explicitly specify that the request method should _not_ change.
     Another exception is when the method is set to â€˜POSTâ€™, in which
     case the redirection rules specified under â€˜--post-dataâ€™ are
     followed.

â€˜--content-dispositionâ€™

     If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support
     for â€˜Content-Dispositionâ€™ headers is enabled.  This can currently
     result in extra round-trips to the server for a â€˜HEADâ€™ request, and
     is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not
     currently enabled by default.

     This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that
     use â€˜Content-Dispositionâ€™ headers to describe what the name of a
     downloaded file should be.

     When combined with â€˜--metalink-over-httpâ€™ and
     â€˜--trust-server-namesâ€™, a â€˜Content-Type: application/metalink4+xmlâ€™
     file is named using the â€˜Content-Dispositionâ€™ filename field, if
     available.

â€˜--content-on-errorâ€™

     If this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when the
     server responds with a http status code that indicates error.

â€˜--trust-server-namesâ€™

     If this is set, on a redirect, the local file name will be based on
     the redirection URL. By default the local file name is based on the
     original URL. When doing recursive retrieving this can be helpful
     because in many web sites redirected URLs correspond to an
     underlying file structure, while link URLs do not.

â€˜--auth-no-challengeâ€™

     If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP authentication
     information (plaintext username and password) for all requests,
     just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by default.

     Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only to
     support some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP
     authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info, say,
     in addition to form-based authentication.

â€˜--retry-on-host-errorâ€™
     Consider host errors, such as â€œTemporary failure in name
     resolutionâ€, as non-fatal, transient errors.

â€˜--retry-on-http-error=CODE[,CODE,...]â€™
     Consider given HTTP response codes as non-fatal, transient errors.
     Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit HTTP response codes as
     argument.  Useful to work around special circumstances where
     retries are required, but the server responds with an error code
     normally not retried by Wget.  Such errors might be 503 (Service
     Unavailable) and 429 (Too Many Requests).  Retries enabled by this
     option are performed subject to the normal retry timing and retry
     count limitations of Wget.

     Using this option is intended to support special use cases only and
     is generally not recommended, as it can force retries even in cases
     where the server is actually trying to decrease its load.  Please
     use wisely and only if you know what you are doing.

2.8 HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options
===========================

To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be compiled with
an external SSL library.  The current default is GnuTLS. In addition,
Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).  If Wget is
compiled without SSL support, none of these options are available.

â€˜--secure-protocol=PROTOCOLâ€™
     Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are â€˜autoâ€™,
     â€˜SSLv2â€™, â€˜SSLv3â€™, â€˜TLSv1â€™, â€˜TLSv1_1â€™, â€˜TLSv1_2â€™, â€˜TLSv1_3â€™ and
     â€˜PFSâ€™.  If â€˜autoâ€™ is used, the SSL library is given the liberty of
     choosing the appropriate protocol automatically, which is achieved
     by sending a TLSv1 greeting.  This is the default.

     Specifying â€˜SSLv2â€™, â€˜SSLv3â€™, â€˜TLSv1â€™, â€˜TLSv1_1â€™, â€˜TLSv1_2â€™ or
     â€˜TLSv1_3â€™ forces the use of the corresponding protocol.  This is
     useful when talking to old and buggy SSL server implementations
     that make it hard for the underlying SSL library to choose the
     correct protocol version.  Fortunately, such servers are quite
     rare.

     Specifying â€˜PFSâ€™ enforces the use of the so-called Perfect Forward
     Security cipher suites.  In short, PFS adds security by creating a
     one-time key for each SSL connection.  It has a bit more CPU impact
     on client and server.  We use known to be secure ciphers (e.g.  no
     MD4) and the TLS protocol.  This mode also explicitly excludes
     non-PFS key exchange methods, such as RSA.

â€˜--https-onlyâ€™
     When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.

â€˜--ciphersâ€™
     Set the cipher list string.  Typically this string sets the cipher
     suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish should be used,
     in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it â€™priority stringâ€™).
     This string will be fed verbatim to the SSL/TLS engine (OpenSSL or
     GnuTLS) and hence its format and syntax is dependent on that.  Wget
     will not process or manipulate it in any way.  Refer to the OpenSSL
     or GnuTLS documentation for more information.

â€˜--no-check-certificateâ€™
     Donâ€™t check the server certificate against the available
     certificate authorities.  Also donâ€™t require the URL host name to
     match the common name presented by the certificate.

     As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the serverâ€™s certificate
     against the recognized certificate authorities, breaking the SSL
     handshake and aborting the download if the verification fails.
     Although this provides more secure downloads, it does break
     interoperability with some sites that worked with previous Wget
     versions, particularly those using self-signed, expired, or
     otherwise invalid certificates.  This option forces an â€œinsecureâ€
     mode of operation that turns the certificate verification errors
     into warnings and allows you to proceed.

     If you encounter â€œcertificate verificationâ€ errors or ones saying
     that â€œcommon name doesnâ€™t match requested host nameâ€, you can use
     this option to bypass the verification and proceed with the
     download.  _Only use this option if you are otherwise convinced of
     the siteâ€™s authenticity, or if you really donâ€™t care about the
     validity of its certificate._  It is almost always a bad idea not
     to check the certificates when transmitting confidential or
     important data.  For self-signed/internal certificates, you should
     download the certificate and verify against that instead of forcing
     this insecure mode.  If you are really sure of not desiring any
     certificate verification, you can specify â€“check-certificate=quiet
     to tell wget to not print any warning about invalid certificates,
     albeit in most cases this is the wrong thing to do.

â€˜--certificate=FILEâ€™
     Use the client certificate stored in FILE.  This is needed for
     servers that are configured to require certificates from the
     clients that connect to them.  Normally a certificate is not
     required and this switch is optional.

â€˜--certificate-type=TYPEâ€™
     Specify the type of the client certificate.  Legal values are â€˜PEMâ€™
     (assumed by default) and â€˜DERâ€™, also known as â€˜ASN1â€™.

â€˜--private-key=FILEâ€™
     Read the private key from FILE.  This allows you to provide the
     private key in a file separate from the certificate.

â€˜--private-key-type=TYPEâ€™
     Specify the type of the private key.  Accepted values are â€˜PEMâ€™
     (the default) and â€˜DERâ€™.

â€˜--ca-certificate=FILEâ€™
     Use FILE as the file with the bundle of certificate authorities
     (â€œCAâ€) to verify the peers.  The certificates must be in PEM
     format.

     Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
     system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

â€˜--ca-directory=DIRECTORYâ€™
     Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.  Each
     file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is based on a
     hash value derived from the certificate.  This is achieved by
     processing a certificate directory with the â€˜c_rehashâ€™ utility
     supplied with OpenSSL. Using â€˜--ca-directoryâ€™ is more efficient
     than â€˜--ca-certificateâ€™ when many certificates are installed
     because it allows Wget to fetch certificates on demand.

     Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
     system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation time.

â€˜--crl-file=FILEâ€™
     Specifies a CRL file in FILE.  This is needed for certificates that
     have been revocated by the CAs.

â€˜--pinnedpubkey=file/hashesâ€™
     Tells wget to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to
     verify the peer.  This can be a path to a file which contains a
     single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64
     encoded sha256 hashes preceded by â€œsha256//â€ and separated by â€œ;â€

     When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a
     certificate indicating its identity.  A public key is extracted
     from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the public
     key(s) provided to this option, wget will abort the connection
     before sending or receiving any data.

â€˜--random-file=FILEâ€™
     [OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use FILE as the source of random data
     for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on systems without
     â€˜/dev/urandomâ€™.

     On such systems the SSL library needs an external source of
     randomness to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by EGD (see
     â€˜--egd-fileâ€™ below) or read from an external source specified by
     the user.  If this option is not specified, Wget looks for random
     data in â€˜$RANDFILEâ€™ or, if that is unset, in â€˜$HOME/.rndâ€™.

     If youâ€™re getting the â€œCould not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling SSL.â€
     error, you should provide random data using some of the methods
     described above.

â€˜--egd-file=FILEâ€™
     [OpenSSL only] Use FILE as the EGD socket.  EGD stands for â€œEntropy
     Gathering Daemonâ€, a user-space program that collects data from
     various unpredictable system sources and makes it available to
     other programs that might need it.  Encryption software, such as
     the SSL library, needs sources of non-repeating randomness to seed
     the random number generator used to produce cryptographically
     strong keys.

     OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy using
     the â€˜RAND_FILEâ€™ environment variable.  If this variable is unset,
     or if the specified file does not produce enough randomness,
     OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket specified using this
     option.

     If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup command
     is not used), EGD is never contacted.  EGD is not needed on modern
     Unix systems that support â€˜/dev/urandomâ€™.

â€˜--no-hstsâ€™
     Wget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security, RFC 6797) by
     default.  Use â€˜--no-hstsâ€™ to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-compliant
     UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all the
     â€˜Strict-Transport-Securityâ€™ headers, and would not enforce any
     existing HSTS policy.

â€˜--hsts-file=FILEâ€™
     By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in â€˜~/.wget-hstsâ€™.  You
     can use â€˜--hsts-fileâ€™ to override this.  Wget will use the supplied
     file as the HSTS database.  Such file must conform to the correct
     HSTS database format used by Wget.  If Wget cannot parse the
     provided file, the behaviour is unspecified.

     The Wgetâ€™s HSTS database is a plain text file.  Each line contains
     an HSTS entry (ie.  a site that has issued a
     â€˜Strict-Transport-Securityâ€™ header and that therefore has specified
     a concrete HSTS policy to be applied).  Lines starting with a dash
     (â€˜#â€™) are ignored by Wget.  Please note that in spite of this
     convenient human-readability hand-hacking the HSTS database is
     generally not a good idea.

     An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by one or
     more whitespace:

     â€˜<hostname> SP [<port>] SP <include subdomains> SP <created> SP
     <max-age>â€™

     The HOSTNAME and PORT fields indicate the hostname and port to
     which the given HSTS policy applies.  The PORT field may be zero,
     and it will, in most of the cases.  That means that the port number
     will not be taken into account when deciding whether such HSTS
     policy should be applied on a given request (only the hostname will
     be evaluated).  When PORT is different to zero, both the target
     hostname and the port will be evaluated and the HSTS policy will
     only be applied if both of them match.  This feature has been
     included for testing/development purposes only.  The Wget testsuite
     (in â€˜testenv/â€™) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the
     purpose of ensuring Wgetâ€™s correct behaviour.  Applying HSTS
     policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged by RFC
     6797 (see Appendix B "Differences between HSTS Policy and
     Same-Origin Policy").  Thus, this functionality should not be used
     in production environments and PORT will typically be zero.  The
     last three fields do what they are expected to.  The field
     INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS can either be â€˜1â€™ or â€˜0â€™ and it signals whether
     the subdomains of the target domain should be part of the given
     HSTS policy as well.  The CREATED and MAX-AGE fields hold the
     timestamp values of when such entry was created (first seen by
     Wget) and the HSTS-defined value â€™max-ageâ€™, which states how long
     should that HSTS policy remain active, measured in seconds elapsed
     since the timestamp stored in CREATED.  Once that time has passed,
     that HSTS policy will no longer be valid and will eventually be
     removed from the database.

     If you supply your own HSTS database via â€˜--hsts-fileâ€™, be aware
     that Wget may modify the provided file if any change occurs between
     the HSTS policies requested by the remote servers and those in the
     file.  When Wget exits, it effectively updates the HSTS database by
     rewriting the database file with the new entries.

     If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one.  This
     file will contain the new HSTS entries.  If no HSTS entries were
     generated (no â€˜Strict-Transport-Securityâ€™ headers were sent by any
     of the servers) then no file will be created, not even an empty
     one.  This behaviour applies to the default database file
     (â€˜~/.wget-hstsâ€™) as well: it will not be created until some server
     enforces an HSTS policy.

     Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other Wget
     processes at the same time over the HSTS database.  Before dumping
     the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget will re-read it and
     merge the changes.

     Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one is
     discouraged.  For more information about the potential security
     threats arose from such practice, see section 14 "Security
     Considerations" of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9 "Creative
     Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store".

â€˜--warc-file=FILEâ€™
     Use FILE as the destination WARC file.

â€˜--warc-header=STRINGâ€™
     Use STRING into as the warcinfo record.

â€˜--warc-max-size=SIZEâ€™
     Set the maximum size of the WARC files to SIZE.

â€˜--warc-cdxâ€™
     Write CDX index files.

â€˜--warc-dedup=FILEâ€™
     Do not store records listed in this CDX file.

â€˜--no-warc-compressionâ€™
     Do not compress WARC files with GZIP.

â€˜--no-warc-digestsâ€™
     Do not calculate SHA1 digests.

â€˜--no-warc-keep-logâ€™
     Do not store the log file in a WARC record.

â€˜--warc-tempdir=DIRâ€™
     Specify the location for temporary files created by the WARC
     writer.

2.9 FTP Options
===============

â€˜--ftp-user=USERâ€™
â€˜--ftp-password=PASSWORDâ€™
     Specify the username USER and password PASSWORD on an FTP server.
     Without this, or the corresponding startup option, the password
     defaults to â€˜-wget@â€™, normally used for anonymous FTP.

     Another way to specify username and password is in the URL itself
     (*note URL Format::).  Either method reveals your password to
     anyone who bothers to run â€˜psâ€™.  To prevent the passwords from
     being seen, store them in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ or â€˜.netrcâ€™, and make sure to
     protect those files from other users with â€˜chmodâ€™.  If the
     passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in those
     files eitherâ€”edit the files and delete them after Wget has started
     the download.

â€˜--no-remove-listingâ€™
     Donâ€™t remove the temporary â€˜.listingâ€™ files generated by FTP
     retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
     listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
     useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to
     easily check on the contents of remote server directories (e.g.  to
     verify that a mirror youâ€™re running is complete).

     Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for this
     file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a user making
     â€˜.listingâ€™ a symbolic link to â€˜/etc/passwdâ€™ or something and asking
     â€˜rootâ€™ to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on the
     options used, either Wget will refuse to write to â€˜.listingâ€™,
     making the globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
     symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
     â€˜.listingâ€™ file, or the listing will be written to a
     â€˜.listing.NUMBERâ€™ file.

     Even though this situation isnâ€™t a problem, though, â€˜rootâ€™ should
     never run Wget in a non-trusted userâ€™s directory.  A user could do
     something as simple as linking â€˜index.htmlâ€™ to â€˜/etc/passwdâ€™ and
     asking â€˜rootâ€™ to run Wget with â€˜-Nâ€™ or â€˜-râ€™ so the file will be
     overwritten.

â€˜--no-globâ€™
     Turn off FTP globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-like
     special characters (â€œwildcardsâ€), like â€˜*â€™, â€˜?â€™, â€˜[â€™ and â€˜]â€™ to
     retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once, like:

          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg

     By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
     globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing on or
     off permanently.

     You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being expanded by
     your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a directory listing,
     which is system-specific.  This is why it currently works only with
     Unix FTP servers (and the ones emulating Unix â€˜lsâ€™ output).

â€˜--no-passive-ftpâ€™
     Disable the use of the â€œpassiveâ€ FTP transfer mode.  Passive FTP
     mandates that the client connect to the server to establish the
     data connection rather than the other way around.

     If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both passive
     and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most firewall and
     NAT configurations passive FTP has a better chance of working.
     However, in some rare firewall configurations, active FTP actually
     works when passive FTP doesnâ€™t.  If you suspect this to be the
     case, use this option, or set â€˜passive_ftp=offâ€™ in your init file.

â€˜--preserve-permissionsâ€™
     Preserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set by
     umask.

â€˜--retr-symlinksâ€™
     By default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a
     symbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed and
     the pointed-to files are retrieved.  Currently, Wget does not
     traverse symbolic links to directories to download them
     recursively, though this feature may be added in the future.

     When â€˜--retr-symlinks=noâ€™ is specified, the linked-to file is not
     downloaded.  Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the
     local filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be retrieved unless
     this recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and
     downloaded it anyway.  This option poses a security risk where a
     malicious FTP Server may cause Wget to write to files outside of
     the intended directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.

     Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it was
     specified on the command-line, rather than because it was recursed
     to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are always traversed
     in this case.

2.10 FTPS Options
=================

â€˜--ftps-implicitâ€™
     This option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly.  Implicit FTPS
     consists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of the
     control connection.  This option does not send an â€˜AUTH TLSâ€™
     command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly starts an
     SSL/TLS connection.  If the attempt is successful, the session
     continues just like regular FTPS (â€˜PBSZâ€™ and â€˜PROTâ€™ are sent,
     etc.).  Implicit FTPS is no longer a requirement for FTPS
     implementations, and thus many servers may not support it.  If
     â€˜--ftps-implicitâ€™ is passed and no explicit port number specified,
     the default port for implicit FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of
     the default port for the "normal" (explicit) FTPS which is the same
     as that of FTP, 21.

â€˜--no-ftps-resume-sslâ€™
     Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel.  When
     starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS
     session previously started in the control connection.  SSL/TLS
     session resumption avoids performing an entirely new handshake by
     reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous session.  Typically,
     the FTPS servers want it that way, so Wget does this by default.
     Under rare circumstances however, one might want to start an
     entirely new SSL/TLS session in every data connection.  This is
     what â€˜--no-ftps-resume-sslâ€™ is for.

â€˜--ftps-clear-data-connectionâ€™
     All the data connections will be in plain text.  Only the control
     connection will be under SSL/TLS. Wget will send a â€˜PROT Câ€™ command
     to achieve this, which must be approved by the server.

â€˜--ftps-fallback-to-ftpâ€™
     Fall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by the target server.
     For security reasons, this option is not asserted by default.  The
     default behaviour is to exit with an error.  If a server does not
     successfully reply to the initial â€˜AUTH TLSâ€™ command, or in the
     case of implicit FTPS, if the initial SSL/TLS connection attempt is
     rejected, it is considered that such server does not support FTPS.

2.11 Recursive Retrieval Options
================================

â€˜-râ€™
â€˜--recursiveâ€™
     Turn on recursive retrieving.  *Note Recursive Download::, for more
     details.  The default maximum depth is 5.

â€˜-l DEPTHâ€™
â€˜--level=DEPTHâ€™
     Set the maximum number of subdirectories that Wget will recurse
     into to DEPTH.  In order to prevent one from accidentally
     downloading very large websites when using recursion this is
     limited to a depth of 5 by default, i.e., it will traverse at most
     5 directories deep starting from the provided URL. Set â€˜-l 0â€™ or
     â€˜-l infâ€™ for infinite recursion depth.

          wget -r -l 0 http://SITE/1.html

     Ideally, one would expect this to download just â€˜1.htmlâ€™.  but
     unfortunately this is not the case, because â€˜-l 0â€™ is equivalent to
     â€˜-l infâ€™â€”that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML
     page (or a handful of them), specify them all on the command line
     and leave away â€˜-râ€™ and â€˜-lâ€™.  To download the essential items to
     view a single HTML page, see â€˜page requisitesâ€™.

â€˜--delete-afterâ€™
     This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
     _after_ having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
     pages through a proxy, e.g.:

          wget -r -nd --delete-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/

     The â€˜-râ€™ option is to retrieve recursively, and â€˜-ndâ€™ to not create
     directories.

     Note that â€˜--delete-afterâ€™ deletes files on the local machine.  It
     does not issue the â€˜DELEâ€™ command to remote FTP sites, for
     instance.  Also note that when â€˜--delete-afterâ€™ is specified,
     â€˜--convert-linksâ€™ is ignored, so â€˜.origâ€™ files are simply not
     created in the first place.

â€˜-kâ€™
â€˜--convert-linksâ€™
     After the download is complete, convert the links in the document
     to make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the
     visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to
     external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets,
     hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.

     Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

        â€¢ The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be
          changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

          Example: if the downloaded file â€˜/foo/doc.htmlâ€™ links to
          â€˜/bar/img.gifâ€™, also downloaded, then the link in â€˜doc.htmlâ€™
          will be modified to point to â€˜../bar/img.gifâ€™.  This kind of
          transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of
          directories.

        â€¢ The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will
          be changed to include host name and absolute path of the
          location they point to.

          Example: if the downloaded file â€˜/foo/doc.htmlâ€™ links to
          â€˜/bar/img.gifâ€™ (or to â€˜../bar/img.gifâ€™), then the link in
          â€˜doc.htmlâ€™ will be modified to point to
          â€˜http://HOSTNAME/bar/img.gifâ€™.

     Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file
     was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was
     not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address
     rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former
     links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the
     downloaded hierarchy to another directory.

     Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links
     have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by â€˜-kâ€™ will
     be performed at the end of all the downloads.

â€˜--convert-file-onlyâ€™
     This option converts only the filename part of the URLs, leaving
     the rest of the URLs untouched.  This filename part is sometimes
     referred to as the "basename", although we avoid that term here in
     order not to cause confusion.

     It works particularly well in conjunction with
     â€˜--adjust-extensionâ€™, although this coupling is not enforced.  It
     proves useful to populate Internet caches with files downloaded
     from different hosts.

     Example: if some link points to â€˜//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyzâ€™ with
     â€˜--adjust-extensionâ€™ asserted and its local destination is intended
     to be â€˜./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.cssâ€™, then the link would be converted
     to â€˜//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.cssâ€™.  Note that only the filename part
     has been modified.  The rest of the URL has been left untouched,
     including the net path (â€˜//â€™) which would otherwise be processed by
     Wget and converted to the effective scheme (ie.  â€˜http://â€™).

â€˜-Kâ€™
â€˜--backup-convertedâ€™
     When converting a file, back up the original version with a â€˜.origâ€™
     suffix.  Affects the behavior of â€˜-Nâ€™ (*note HTTP Time-Stamping
     Internals::).

â€˜-mâ€™
â€˜--mirrorâ€™
     Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
     recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and
     keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to â€˜-r -N
     -l inf --no-remove-listingâ€™.

â€˜-pâ€™
â€˜--page-requisitesâ€™
     This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
     necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This includes
     such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.

     Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any requisite
     documents that may be needed to display it properly are not
     downloaded.  Using â€˜-râ€™ together with â€˜-lâ€™ can help, but since Wget
     does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined
     documents, one is generally left with â€œleaf documentsâ€ that are
     missing their requisites.

     For instance, say document â€˜1.htmlâ€™ contains an â€˜<IMG>â€™ tag
     referencing â€˜1.gifâ€™ and an â€˜<A>â€™ tag pointing to external document
     â€˜2.htmlâ€™.  Say that â€˜2.htmlâ€™ is similar but that its image is
     â€˜2.gifâ€™ and it links to â€˜3.htmlâ€™.  Say this continues up to some
     arbitrarily high number.

     If one executes the command:

          wget -r -l 2 http://SITE/1.html

     then â€˜1.htmlâ€™, â€˜1.gifâ€™, â€˜2.htmlâ€™, â€˜2.gifâ€™, and â€˜3.htmlâ€™ will be
     downloaded.  As you can see, â€˜3.htmlâ€™ is without its requisite
     â€˜3.gifâ€™ because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to
     2) away from â€˜1.htmlâ€™ in order to determine where to stop the
     recursion.  However, with this command:

          wget -r -l 2 -p http://SITE/1.html

     all the above files _and_ â€˜3.htmlâ€™â€™s requisite â€˜3.gifâ€™ will be
     downloaded.  Similarly,

          wget -r -l 1 -p http://SITE/1.html

     will cause â€˜1.htmlâ€™, â€˜1.gifâ€™, â€˜2.htmlâ€™, and â€˜2.gifâ€™ to be
     downloaded.  One might think that:

          wget -r -l 0 -p http://SITE/1.html

     would download just â€˜1.htmlâ€™ and â€˜1.gifâ€™, but unfortunately this is
     not the case, because â€˜-l 0â€™ is equivalent to â€˜-l infâ€™â€”that is,
     infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a handful
     of them, all specified on the command-line or in a â€˜-iâ€™ URL input
     file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off â€˜-râ€™ and
     â€˜-lâ€™:

          wget -p http://SITE/1.html

     Note that Wget will behave as if â€˜-râ€™ had been specified, but only
     that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from
     that page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to
     download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist
     on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly
     locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to
     â€˜-pâ€™:

          wget -E -H -k -K -p http://SITE/DOCUMENT

     To finish off this topic, itâ€™s worth knowing that Wgetâ€™s idea of an
     external document link is any URL specified in an â€˜<A>â€™ tag, an
     â€˜<AREA>â€™ tag, or a â€˜<LINK>â€™ tag other than â€˜<LINK
     REL="stylesheet">â€™.

â€˜--strict-commentsâ€™
     Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments.  The default is to
     terminate comments at the first occurrence of â€˜-->â€™.

     According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as SGML
     â€œdeclarationsâ€.  Declaration is special markup that begins with
     â€˜<!â€™ and ends with â€˜>â€™, such as â€˜<!DOCTYPE ...>â€™, that may contain
     comments between a pair of â€˜--â€™ delimiters.  HTML comments are
     â€œempty declarationsâ€, SGML declarations without any non-comment
     text.  Therefore, â€˜<!--foo-->â€™ is a valid comment, and so is
     â€˜<!--one-- --two-->â€™, but â€˜<!--1--2-->â€™ is not.

     On the other hand, most HTML writers donâ€™t perceive comments as
     anything other than text delimited with â€˜<!--â€™ and â€˜-->â€™, which is
     not quite the same.  For example, something like â€˜<!------------>â€™
     works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a
     multiple of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until
     the next â€˜--â€™, which may be at the other end of the document.
     Because of this, many popular browsers completely ignore the
     specification and implement what users have come to expect:
     comments delimited with â€˜<!--â€™ and â€˜-->â€™.

     Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which
     resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in
     browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant
     comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of
     clients that implements â€œnaiveâ€ comments, terminating each comment
     at the first occurrence of â€˜-->â€™.

     If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
     option to turn it on.

2.12 Recursive Accept/Reject Options
====================================

â€˜-A ACCLIST --accept ACCLISTâ€™
â€˜-R REJLIST --reject REJLISTâ€™
     Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
     accept or reject (*note Types of Files::).  Note that if any of the
     wildcard characters, â€˜*â€™, â€˜?â€™, â€˜[â€™ or â€˜]â€™, appear in an element of
     ACCLIST or REJLIST, it will be treated as a pattern, rather than a
     suffix.  In this case, you have to enclose the pattern into quotes
     to prevent your shell from expanding it, like in â€˜-A "*.mp3"â€™ or
     â€˜-A '*.mp3'â€™.

â€˜--accept-regex URLREGEXâ€™
â€˜--reject-regex URLREGEXâ€™
     Specify a regular expression to accept or reject the complete URL.

â€˜--regex-type REGEXTYPEâ€™
     Specify the regular expression type.  Possible types are â€˜posixâ€™ or
     â€˜pcreâ€™.  Note that to be able to use â€˜pcreâ€™ type, wget has to be
     compiled with libpcre support.

â€˜-D DOMAIN-LISTâ€™
â€˜--domains=DOMAIN-LISTâ€™
     Set domains to be followed.  DOMAIN-LIST is a comma-separated list
     of domains.  Note that it does _not_ turn on â€˜-Hâ€™.

â€˜--exclude-domains DOMAIN-LISTâ€™
     Specify the domains that are _not_ to be followed (*note Spanning
     Hosts::).

â€˜--follow-ftpâ€™
     Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option, Wget
     will ignore all the FTP links.

â€˜--follow-tags=LISTâ€™
     Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that it
     considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
     retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
     considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
     comma-separated LIST with this option.

â€˜--ignore-tags=LISTâ€™
     This is the opposite of the â€˜--follow-tagsâ€™ option.  To skip
     certain HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to
     download, specify them in a comma-separated LIST.

     In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a single
     page and its requisites, using a command-line like:

          wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r http://SITE/DOCUMENT

     However, the author of this option came across a page with tags
     like â€˜<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">â€™ and came to the realization that
     specifying tags to ignore was not enough.  One canâ€™t just tell Wget
     to ignore â€˜<LINK>â€™, because then stylesheets will not be
     downloaded.  Now the best bet for downloading a single page and its
     requisites is the dedicated â€˜--page-requisitesâ€™ option.

â€˜--ignore-caseâ€™
     Ignore case when matching files and directories.  This influences
     the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as well as globbing
     implemented when downloading from FTP sites.  For example, with
     this option, â€˜-A "*.txt"â€™ will match â€˜file1.txtâ€™, but also
     â€˜file2.TXTâ€™, â€˜file3.TxTâ€™, and so on.  The quotes in the example are
     to prevent the shell from expanding the pattern.

â€˜-Hâ€™
â€˜--span-hostsâ€™
     Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving (*note
     Spanning Hosts::).

â€˜-Lâ€™
â€˜--relativeâ€™
     Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home
     page without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts
     (*note Relative Links::).

â€˜-I LISTâ€™
â€˜--include-directories=LISTâ€™
     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow
     when downloading (*note Directory-Based Limits::).  Elements of
     LIST may contain wildcards.

â€˜-X LISTâ€™
â€˜--exclude-directories=LISTâ€™
     Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude
     from download (*note Directory-Based Limits::).  Elements of LIST
     may contain wildcards.

â€˜-npâ€™
â€˜--no-parentâ€™
     Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
     recursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees that
     only the files _below_ a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.
     *Note Directory-Based Limits::, for more details.

2.13 Exit Status
================

Wget may return one of several error codes if it encounters problems.

0
     No problems occurred.

1
     Generic error code.

2
     Parse errorâ€”for instance, when parsing command-line options, the
     â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ or â€˜.netrcâ€™...

3
     File I/O error.

4
     Network failure.

5
     SSL verification failure.

6
     Username/password authentication failure.

7
     Protocol errors.

8
     Server issued an error response.

   With the exceptions of 0 and 1, the lower-numbered exit codes take
precedence over higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of errors are
encountered.

   In versions of Wget prior to 1.12, Wgetâ€™s exit status tended to be
unhelpful and inconsistent.  Recursive downloads would virtually always
return 0 (success), regardless of any issues encountered, and
non-recursive fetches only returned the status corresponding to the most
recently-attempted download.

3 Recursive Download
********************

GNU Wget is capable of traversing parts of the Web (or a single HTTP or
FTP server), following links and directory structure.  We refer to this
as to â€œrecursive retrievalâ€, or â€œrecursionâ€.

   With HTTP URLs, Wget retrieves and parses the HTML or CSS from the
given URL, retrieving the files the document refers to, through markup
like â€˜hrefâ€™ or â€˜srcâ€™, or CSS URI values specified using the â€˜url()â€™
functional notation.  If the freshly downloaded file is also of type
â€˜text/htmlâ€™, â€˜application/xhtml+xmlâ€™, or â€˜text/cssâ€™, it will be parsed
and followed further.

   Recursive retrieval of HTTP and HTML/CSS content is â€œbreadth-firstâ€.
This means that Wget first downloads the requested document, then the
documents linked from that document, then the documents linked by them,
and so on.  In other words, Wget first downloads the documents at depth
1, then those at depth 2, and so on until the specified maximum depth.

   The maximum â€œdepthâ€ to which the retrieval may descend is specified
with the â€˜-lâ€™ option.  The default maximum depth is five layers.

   When retrieving an FTP URL recursively, Wget will retrieve all the
data from the given directory tree (including the subdirectories up to
the specified depth) on the remote server, creating its mirror image
locally.  FTP retrieval is also limited by the â€˜depthâ€™ parameter.
Unlike HTTP recursion, FTP recursion is performed depth-first.

   By default, Wget will create a local directory tree, corresponding to
the one found on the remote server.

   Recursive retrieving can find a number of applications, the most
important of which is mirroring.  It is also useful for WWW
presentations, and any other opportunities where slow network
connections should be bypassed by storing the files locally.

   You should be warned that recursive downloads can overload the remote
servers.  Because of that, many administrators frown upon them and may
ban access from your site if they detect very fast downloads of big
amounts of content.  When downloading from Internet servers, consider
using the â€˜-wâ€™ option to introduce a delay between accesses to the
server.  The download will take a while longer, but the server
administrator will not be alarmed by your rudeness.

   Of course, recursive download may cause problems on your machine.  If
left to run unchecked, it can easily fill up the disk.  If downloading
from local network, it can also take bandwidth on the system, as well as
consume memory and CPU.

   Try to specify the criteria that match the kind of download you are
trying to achieve.  If you want to download only one page, use
â€˜--page-requisitesâ€™ without any additional recursion.  If you want to
download things under one directory, use â€˜-npâ€™ to avoid downloading
things from other directories.  If you want to download all the files
from one directory, use â€˜-l 1â€™ to make sure the recursion depth never
exceeds one.  *Note Following Links::, for more information about this.

   Recursive retrieval should be used with care.  Donâ€™t say you were not
warned.

4 Following Links
*****************

When retrieving recursively, one does not wish to retrieve loads of
unnecessary data.  Most of the time the users bear in mind exactly what
they want to download, and want Wget to follow only specific links.

   For example, if you wish to download the music archive from
â€˜fly.srk.fer.hrâ€™, you will not want to download all the home pages that
happen to be referenced by an obscure part of the archive.

   Wget possesses several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which
links it will follow.

4.1 Spanning Hosts
==================

Wgetâ€™s recursive retrieval normally refuses to visit hosts different
than the one you specified on the command line.  This is a reasonable
default; without it, every retrieval would have the potential to turn
your Wget into a small version of google.

   However, visiting different hosts, or â€œhost spanning,â€ is sometimes a
useful option.  Maybe the images are served from a different server.
Maybe youâ€™re mirroring a site that consists of pages interlinked between
three servers.  Maybe the server has two equivalent names, and the HTML
pages refer to both interchangeably.

Span to any hostâ€”â€˜-Hâ€™

     The â€˜-Hâ€™ option turns on host spanning, thus allowing Wgetâ€™s
     recursive run to visit any host referenced by a link.  Unless
     sufficient recursion-limiting criteria are applied depth, these
     foreign hosts will typically link to yet more hosts, and so on
     until Wget ends up sucking up much more data than you have
     intended.

Limit spanning to certain domainsâ€”â€˜-Dâ€™

     The â€˜-Dâ€™ option allows you to specify the domains that will be
     followed, thus limiting the recursion only to the hosts that belong
     to these domains.  Obviously, this makes sense only in conjunction
     with â€˜-Hâ€™.  A typical example would be downloading the contents of
     â€˜www.example.comâ€™, but allowing downloads from
     â€˜images.example.comâ€™, etc.:

          wget -rH -Dexample.com http://www.example.com/

     You can specify more than one address by separating them with a
     comma, e.g.  â€˜-Ddomain1.com,domain2.comâ€™.

Keep download off certain domainsâ€”â€˜--exclude-domainsâ€™

     If there are domains you want to exclude specifically, you can do
     it with â€˜--exclude-domainsâ€™, which accepts the same type of
     arguments of â€˜-Dâ€™, but will _exclude_ all the listed domains.  For
     example, if you want to download all the hosts from â€˜foo.eduâ€™
     domain, with the exception of â€˜sunsite.foo.eduâ€™, you can do it like
     this:

          wget -rH -Dfoo.edu --exclude-domains sunsite.foo.edu \
              http://www.foo.edu/

4.2 Types of Files
==================

When downloading material from the web, you will often want to restrict
the retrieval to only certain file types.  For example, if you are
interested in downloading GIFs, you will not be overjoyed to get loads
of PostScript documents, and vice versa.

   Wget offers two options to deal with this problem.  Each option
description lists a short name, a long name, and the equivalent command
in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.

â€˜-A ACCLISTâ€™
â€˜--accept ACCLISTâ€™
â€˜accept = ACCLISTâ€™
â€˜--accept-regex URLREGEXâ€™
â€˜accept-regex = URLREGEXâ€™
     The argument to â€˜--acceptâ€™ option is a list of file suffixes or
     patterns that Wget will download during recursive retrieval.  A
     suffix is the ending part of a file, and consists of â€œnormalâ€
     letters, e.g.  â€˜gifâ€™ or â€˜.jpgâ€™.  A matching pattern contains
     shell-like wildcards, e.g.  â€˜books*â€™ or â€˜zelazny*196[0-9]*â€™.

     So, specifying â€˜wget -A gif,jpgâ€™ will make Wget download only the
     files ending with â€˜gifâ€™ or â€˜jpgâ€™, i.e.  GIFs and JPEGs.  On the
     other hand, â€˜wget -A "zelazny*196[0-9]*"â€™ will download only files
     beginning with â€˜zelaznyâ€™ and containing numbers from 1960 to 1969
     anywhere within.  Look up the manual of your shell for a
     description of how pattern matching works.

     Of course, any number of suffixes and patterns can be combined into
     a comma-separated list, and given as an argument to â€˜-Aâ€™.

     The argument to â€˜--accept-regexâ€™ option is a regular expression
     which is matched against the complete URL.

â€˜-R REJLISTâ€™
â€˜--reject REJLISTâ€™
â€˜reject = REJLISTâ€™
â€˜--reject-regex URLREGEXâ€™
â€˜reject-regex = URLREGEXâ€™
     The â€˜--rejectâ€™ option works the same way as â€˜--acceptâ€™, only its
     logic is the reverse; Wget will download all files _except_ the
     ones matching the suffixes (or patterns) in the list.

     So, if you want to download a whole page except for the cumbersome
     MPEGs and .AU files, you can use â€˜wget -R mpg,mpeg,auâ€™.
     Analogously, to download all files except the ones beginning with
     â€˜bjorkâ€™, use â€˜wget -R "bjork*"â€™.  The quotes are to prevent
     expansion by the shell.

   The argument to â€˜--accept-regexâ€™ option is a regular expression which
is matched against the complete URL.

The â€˜-Aâ€™ and â€˜-Râ€™ options may be combined to achieve even better
fine-tuning of which files to retrieve.  E.g.  â€˜wget -A "*zelazny*" -R
.psâ€™ will download all the files having â€˜zelaznyâ€™ as a part of their
name, but _not_ the PostScript files.

   Note that these two options do not affect the downloading of HTML
files (as determined by a â€˜.htmâ€™ or â€˜.htmlâ€™ filename prefix).  This
behavior may not be desirable for all users, and may be changed for
future versions of Wget.

   Note, too, that query strings (strings at the end of a URL beginning
with a question mark (â€˜?â€™) are not included as part of the filename for
accept/reject rules, even though these will actually contribute to the
name chosen for the local file.  It is expected that a future version of
Wget will provide an option to allow matching against query strings.

   Finally, itâ€™s worth noting that the accept/reject lists are matched
_twice_ against downloaded files: once against the URLâ€™s filename
portion, to determine if the file should be downloaded in the first
place; then, after it has been accepted and successfully downloaded, the
local fileâ€™s name is also checked against the accept/reject lists to see
if it should be removed.  The rationale was that, since â€˜.htmâ€™ and
â€˜.htmlâ€™ files are always downloaded regardless of accept/reject rules,
they should be removed _after_ being downloaded and scanned for links,
if they did match the accept/reject lists.  However, this can lead to
unexpected results, since the local filenames can differ from the
original URL filenames in the following ways, all of which can change
whether an accept/reject rule matches:

   â€¢ If the local file already exists and â€˜--no-directoriesâ€™ was
     specified, a numeric suffix will be appended to the original name.
   â€¢ If â€˜--adjust-extensionâ€™ was specified, the local filename might
     have â€˜.htmlâ€™ appended to it.  If Wget is invoked with â€˜-E -A.phpâ€™,
     a filename such as â€˜index.phpâ€™ will match be accepted, but upon
     download will be named â€˜index.php.htmlâ€™, which no longer matches,
     and so the file will be deleted.
   â€¢ Query strings do not contribute to URL matching, but are included
     in local filenames, and so _do_ contribute to filename matching.

This behavior, too, is considered less-than-desirable, and may change in
a future version of Wget.

4.3 Directory-Based Limits
==========================

Regardless of other link-following facilities, it is often useful to
place the restriction of what files to retrieve based on the directories
those files are placed in.  There can be many reasons for thisâ€”the home
pages may be organized in a reasonable directory structure; or some
directories may contain useless information, e.g.  â€˜/cgi-binâ€™ or â€˜/devâ€™
directories.

   Wget offers three different options to deal with this requirement.
Each option description lists a short name, a long name, and the
equivalent command in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.

â€˜-I LISTâ€™
â€˜--include LISTâ€™
â€˜include_directories = LISTâ€™
     â€˜-Iâ€™ option accepts a comma-separated list of directories included
     in the retrieval.  Any other directories will simply be ignored.
     The directories are absolute paths.

     So, if you wish to download from â€˜http://host/people/bozo/â€™
     following only links to bozoâ€™s colleagues in the â€˜/peopleâ€™
     directory and the bogus scripts in â€˜/cgi-binâ€™, you can specify:

          wget -I /people,/cgi-bin http://host/people/bozo/

â€˜-X LISTâ€™
â€˜--exclude LISTâ€™
â€˜exclude_directories = LISTâ€™
     â€˜-Xâ€™ option is exactly the reverse of â€˜-Iâ€™â€”this is a list of
     directories _excluded_ from the download.  E.g.  if you do not want
     Wget to download things from â€˜/cgi-binâ€™ directory, specify â€˜-X
     /cgi-binâ€™ on the command line.

     The same as with â€˜-Aâ€™/â€˜-Râ€™, these two options can be combined to
     get a better fine-tuning of downloading subdirectories.  E.g.  if
     you want to load all the files from â€˜/pubâ€™ hierarchy except for
     â€˜/pub/worthlessâ€™, specify â€˜-I/pub -X/pub/worthlessâ€™.

â€˜-npâ€™
â€˜--no-parentâ€™
â€˜no_parent = onâ€™
     The simplest, and often very useful way of limiting directories is
     disallowing retrieval of the links that refer to the hierarchy
     â€œaboveâ€ than the beginning directory, i.e.  disallowing ascent to
     the parent directory/directories.

     The â€˜--no-parentâ€™ option (short â€˜-npâ€™) is useful in this case.
     Using it guarantees that you will never leave the existing
     hierarchy.  Supposing you issue Wget with:

          wget -r --no-parent http://somehost/~luzer/my-archive/

     You may rest assured that none of the references to
     â€˜/~his-girls-homepage/â€™ or â€˜/~luzer/all-my-mpegs/â€™ will be
     followed.  Only the archive you are interested in will be
     downloaded.  Essentially, â€˜--no-parentâ€™ is similar to
     â€˜-I/~luzer/my-archiveâ€™, only it handles redirections in a more
     intelligent fashion.

     *Note* that, for HTTP (and HTTPS), the trailing slash is very
     important to â€˜--no-parentâ€™.  HTTP has no concept of a
     â€œdirectoryâ€â€”Wget relies on you to indicate whatâ€™s a directory and
     what isnâ€™t.  In â€˜http://foo/bar/â€™, Wget will consider â€˜barâ€™ to be a
     directory, while in â€˜http://foo/barâ€™ (no trailing slash), â€˜barâ€™
     will be considered a filename (so â€˜--no-parentâ€™ would be
     meaningless, as its parent is â€˜/â€™).

4.4 Relative Links
==================

When â€˜-Lâ€™ is turned on, only the relative links are ever followed.
Relative links are here defined those that do not refer to the web
server root.  For example, these links are relative:

     <a href="foo.gif">
     <a href="foo/bar.gif">
     <a href="../foo/bar.gif">

   These links are not relative:

     <a href="/foo.gif">
     <a href="/foo/bar.gif">
     <a href="http://www.example.com/foo/bar.gif">

   Using this option guarantees that recursive retrieval will not span
hosts, even without â€˜-Hâ€™.  In simple cases it also allows downloads to
â€œjust workâ€ without having to convert links.

   This option is probably not very useful and might be removed in a
future release.

4.5 Following FTP Links
=======================

The rules for FTP are somewhat specific, as it is necessary for them to
be.  FTP links in HTML documents are often included for purposes of
reference, and it is often inconvenient to download them by default.

   To have FTP links followed from HTML documents, you need to specify
the â€˜--follow-ftpâ€™ option.  Having done that, FTP links will span hosts
regardless of â€˜-Hâ€™ setting.  This is logical, as FTP links rarely point
to the same host where the HTTP server resides.  For similar reasons,
the â€˜-Lâ€™ options has no effect on such downloads.  On the other hand,
domain acceptance (â€˜-Dâ€™) and suffix rules (â€˜-Aâ€™ and â€˜-Râ€™) apply
normally.

   Also note that followed links to FTP directories will not be
retrieved recursively further.

5 Time-Stamping
***************

One of the most important aspects of mirroring information from the
Internet is updating your archives.

   Downloading the whole archive again and again, just to replace a few
changed files is expensive, both in terms of wasted bandwidth and money,
and the time to do the update.  This is why all the mirroring tools
offer the option of incremental updating.

   Such an updating mechanism means that the remote server is scanned in
search of â€œnewâ€ files.  Only those new files will be downloaded in the
place of the old ones.

   A file is considered new if one of these two conditions are met:

  1. A file of that name does not already exist locally.

  2. A file of that name does exist, but the remote file was modified
     more recently than the local file.

   To implement this, the program needs to be aware of the time of last
modification of both local and remote files.  We call this information
the â€œtime-stampâ€ of a file.

   The time-stamping in GNU Wget is turned on using â€˜--timestampingâ€™
(â€˜-Nâ€™) option, or through â€˜timestamping = onâ€™ directive in â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.
With this option, for each file it intends to download, Wget will check
whether a local file of the same name exists.  If it does, and the
remote file is not newer, Wget will not download it.

   If the local file does not exist, or the sizes of the files do not
match, Wget will download the remote file no matter what the time-stamps
say.

5.1 Time-Stamping Usage
=======================

The usage of time-stamping is simple.  Say you would like to download a
file so that it keeps its date of modification.

     wget -S http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   A simple â€˜ls -lâ€™ shows that the time stamp on the local file equals
the state of the â€˜Last-Modifiedâ€™ header, as returned by the server.  As
you can see, the time-stamping info is preserved locally, even without
â€˜-Nâ€™ (at least for HTTP).

   Several days later, you would like Wget to check if the remote file
has changed, and download it if it has.

     wget -N http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/

   Wget will ask the server for the last-modified date.  If the local
file has the same timestamp as the server, or a newer one, the remote
file will not be re-fetched.  However, if the remote file is more
recent, Wget will proceed to fetch it.

   The same goes for FTP.  For example:

     wget "ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/emacs/gnus/*"

   (The quotes around that URL are to prevent the shell from trying to
interpret the â€˜*â€™.)

   After download, a local directory listing will show that the
timestamps match those on the remote server.  Reissuing the command with
â€˜-Nâ€™ will make Wget re-fetch _only_ the files that have been modified
since the last download.

   If you wished to mirror the GNU archive every week, you would use a
command like the following, weekly:

     wget --timestamping -r ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/

   Note that time-stamping will only work for files for which the server
gives a timestamp.  For HTTP, this depends on getting a â€˜Last-Modifiedâ€™
header.  For FTP, this depends on getting a directory listing with dates
in a format that Wget can parse (*note FTP Time-Stamping Internals::).

5.2 HTTP Time-Stamping Internals
================================

Time-stamping in HTTP is implemented by checking of the â€˜Last-Modifiedâ€™
header.  If you wish to retrieve the file â€˜foo.htmlâ€™ through HTTP, Wget
will check whether â€˜foo.htmlâ€™ exists locally.  If it doesnâ€™t, â€˜foo.htmlâ€™
will be retrieved unconditionally.

   If the file does exist locally, Wget will first check its local
time-stamp (similar to the way â€˜ls -lâ€™ checks it), and then send a
â€˜HEADâ€™ request to the remote server, demanding the information on the
remote file.

   The â€˜Last-Modifiedâ€™ header is examined to find which file was
modified more recently (which makes it â€œnewerâ€).  If the remote file is
newer, it will be downloaded; if it is older, Wget will give up.(1)

   When â€˜--backup-convertedâ€™ (â€˜-Kâ€™) is specified in conjunction with
â€˜-Nâ€™, server file â€˜Xâ€™ is compared to local file â€˜X.origâ€™, if extant,
rather than being compared to local file â€˜Xâ€™, which will always differ
if itâ€™s been converted by â€˜--convert-linksâ€™ (â€˜-kâ€™).

   Arguably, HTTP time-stamping should be implemented using the
â€˜If-Modified-Sinceâ€™ request.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As an additional check, Wget will look at the â€˜Content-Lengthâ€™
header, and compare the sizes; if they are not the same, the remote file
will be downloaded no matter what the time-stamp says.

5.3 FTP Time-Stamping Internals
===============================

In theory, FTP time-stamping works much the same as HTTP, only FTP has
no headersâ€”time-stamps must be ferreted out of directory listings.

   If an FTP download is recursive or uses globbing, Wget will use the
FTP â€˜LISTâ€™ command to get a file listing for the directory containing
the desired file(s).  It will try to analyze the listing, treating it
like Unix â€˜ls -lâ€™ output, extracting the time-stamps.  The rest is
exactly the same as for HTTP.  Note that when retrieving individual
files from an FTP server without using globbing or recursion, listing
files will not be downloaded (and thus files will not be time-stamped)
unless â€˜-Nâ€™ is specified.

   Assumption that every directory listing is a Unix-style listing may
sound extremely constraining, but in practice it is not, as many
non-Unix FTP servers use the Unixoid listing format because most (all?)
of the clients understand it.  Bear in mind that RFC959 defines no
standard way to get a file list, let alone the time-stamps.  We can only
hope that a future standard will define this.

   Another non-standard solution includes the use of â€˜MDTMâ€™ command that
is supported by some FTP servers (including the popular â€˜wu-ftpdâ€™),
which returns the exact time of the specified file.  Wget may support
this command in the future.

6 Startup File
**************

Once you know how to change default settings of Wget through command
line arguments, you may wish to make some of those settings permanent.
You can do that in a convenient way by creating the Wget startup
fileâ€”â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.

   Besides â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ is the â€œmainâ€ initialization file, it is convenient
to have a special facility for storing passwords.  Thus Wget reads and
interprets the contents of â€˜$HOME/.netrcâ€™, if it finds it.  You can find
â€˜.netrcâ€™ format in your system manuals.

   Wget reads â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ upon startup, recognizing a limited set of
commands.

6.1 Wgetrc Location
===================

When initializing, Wget will look for a â€œglobalâ€ startup file,
â€˜/usr/local/etc/wgetrcâ€™ by default (or some prefix other than
â€˜/usr/localâ€™, if Wget was not installed there) and read commands from
there, if it exists.

   Then it will look for the userâ€™s file.  If the environmental variable
â€˜WGETRCâ€™ is set, Wget will try to load that file.  Failing that, no
further attempts will be made.

   If â€˜WGETRCâ€™ is not set, Wget will try to load â€˜$HOME/.wgetrcâ€™.

   The fact that userâ€™s settings are loaded after the system-wide ones
means that in case of collision userâ€™s wgetrc _overrides_ the
system-wide wgetrc (in â€˜/usr/local/etc/wgetrcâ€™ by default).  Fascist
admins, away!

6.2 Wgetrc Syntax
=================

The syntax of a wgetrc command is simple:

     variable = value

   The â€œvariableâ€ will also be called â€œcommandâ€.  Valid â€œvaluesâ€ are
different for different commands.

   The commands are case-, underscore- and minus-insensitive.  Thus
â€˜DIr__PrefiXâ€™, â€˜DIr-PrefiXâ€™ and â€˜dirprefixâ€™ are the same.  Empty lines,
lines beginning with â€˜#â€™ and lines containing white-space only are
discarded.

   Commands that expect a comma-separated list will clear the list on an
empty command.  So, if you wish to reset the rejection list specified in
global â€˜wgetrcâ€™, you can do it with:

     reject =

6.3 Wgetrc Commands
===================

The complete set of commands is listed below.  Legal values are listed
after the â€˜=â€™.  Simple Boolean values can be set or unset using â€˜onâ€™ and
â€˜offâ€™ or â€˜1â€™ and â€˜0â€™.

   Some commands take pseudo-arbitrary values.  ADDRESS values can be
hostnames or dotted-quad IP addresses.  N can be any positive integer,
or â€˜infâ€™ for infinity, where appropriate.  STRING values can be any
non-empty string.

   Most of these commands have direct command-line equivalents.  Also,
any wgetrc command can be specified on the command line using the
â€˜--executeâ€™ switch (*note Basic Startup Options::.)

It is divided in two sectionâ€”one for global usage (suitable for global
startup file), and one for local usage (suitable for â€˜$HOME/.wgetrcâ€™).
Be careful about the things you change.

   Note that almost all the lines are commented out.  For a command to
have any effect, you must remove the â€˜#â€™ character at the beginning of
its line.

     ## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
     ## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
     ## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
     ## to find out what you can put into this file. You can find this here:
     ##   $ info wget.info 'Startup File'
     ## Or online here:
     ##   https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Startup-File
     ##
     ## Wget initialization file can reside in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
     ## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
     ##
     ## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
     ## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
     ## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").
     ##
     ## Command are case-, underscore- and minus-insensitive.
     ## For example ftp_proxy, ftp-proxy and ftpproxy are the same.


     ##
     ## Global settings (useful for setting up in /usr/local/etc/wgetrc).
     ## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
     ## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
     ##

     # You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
     # optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
     # default quota is unlimited.
     #quota = inf

     # You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
     # downloading a file (default is 20).
     #tries = 20

     # Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
     # prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
     # the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
     #reclevel = 5

     # By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
     # initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
     # way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
     # computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
     # firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
     # problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
     # environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
     #passive_ftp = off

     # The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
     # If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
     # downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
     # will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
     # on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
     #waitretry = 10


     ##
     ## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
     ## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
     ## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
     ##
     ## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
     ## are doing before doing so.
     ##

     # Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
     #timestamping = off

     # It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
     # header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
     # you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
     #header = From: Your Name <username@site.domain>

     # You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
     # is *not* sent by default.
     #header = Accept-Language: en

     # You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http, https, and ftp.
     # They will override the value in the environment.
     #https_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     #http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     #ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

     # If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
     #use_proxy = on

     # You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
     # binary, mega and micro.
     #dot_style = default

     # Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
     # know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
     # the default!
     #robots = on

     # It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
     # the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
     #wait = 0

     # You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
     # retrieved, by setting this to on.
     #dirstruct = off

     # You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
     # you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
     #recursive = off

     # To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
     # to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
     # set this variable to on:
     #backup_converted = off

     # To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this
     # to on:
     #follow_ftp = off

     # To try ipv6 addresses first:
     #prefer-family = IPv6

     # Set default IRI support state
     #iri = off

     # Force the default system encoding
     #localencoding = UTF-8

     # Force the default remote server encoding
     #remoteencoding = UTF-8

     # Turn on to prevent following non-HTTPS links when in recursive mode
     #httpsonly = off

     # Tune HTTPS security (auto, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, PFS)
     #secureprotocol = auto

7 Examples
**********

The examples are divided into three sections loosely based on their
complexity.

7.1 Simple Usage
================

   â€¢ Say you want to download a URL.  Just type:

          wget http://fly.srk.fer.hr/

   â€¢ But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is
     lengthy?  The connection will probably fail before the whole file
     is retrieved, more than once.  In this case, Wget will try getting
     the file until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the
     default number of retries (this being 20).  It is easy to change
     the number of tries to 45, to insure that the whole file will
     arrive safely:

          wget --tries=45 http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg

   â€¢ Now letâ€™s leave Wget to work in the background, and write its
     progress to log file â€˜logâ€™.  It is tiring to type â€˜--triesâ€™, so we
     shall use â€˜-tâ€™.

          wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.srk.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg &

     The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in
     the background.  To unlimit the number of retries, use â€˜-t infâ€™.

   â€¢ The usage of FTP is as simple.  Wget will take care of login and
     password.

          wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/welcome.msg

   â€¢ If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory
     listing, parse it and convert it to HTML.  Try:

          wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/
          links index.html

7.2 Advanced Usage
==================

   â€¢ You have a file that contains the URLs you want to download?  Use
     the â€˜-iâ€™ switch:

          wget -i FILE

     If you specify â€˜-â€™ as file name, the URLs will be read from
     standard input.

   â€¢ Create a five levels deep mirror image of the GNU web site, with
     the same directory structure the original has, with only one try
     per document, saving the log of the activities to â€˜gnulogâ€™:

          wget -r https://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog

   â€¢ The same as the above, but convert the links in the downloaded
     files to point to local files, so you can view the documents
     off-line:

          wget --convert-links -r https://www.gnu.org/ -o gnulog

   â€¢ Retrieve only one HTML page, but make sure that all the elements
     needed for the page to be displayed, such as inline images and
     external style sheets, are also downloaded.  Also make sure the
     downloaded page references the downloaded links.

          wget -p --convert-links http://www.example.com/dir/page.html

     The HTML page will be saved to â€˜www.example.com/dir/page.htmlâ€™, and
     the images, stylesheets, etc., somewhere under â€˜www.example.com/â€™,
     depending on where they were on the remote server.

   â€¢ The same as the above, but without the â€˜www.example.com/â€™
     directory.  In fact, I donâ€™t want to have all those random server
     directories anywayâ€”just save _all_ those files under a â€˜download/â€™
     subdirectory of the current directory.

          wget -p --convert-links -nH -nd -Pdownload \
               http://www.example.com/dir/page.html

   â€¢ Retrieve the index.html of â€˜www.lycos.comâ€™, showing the original
     server headers:

          wget -S http://www.lycos.com/

   â€¢ Save the server headers with the file, perhaps for post-processing.

          wget --save-headers http://www.lycos.com/
          more index.html

   â€¢ Retrieve the first two levels of â€˜wuarchive.wustl.eduâ€™, saving them
     to â€˜/tmpâ€™.

          wget -r -l2 -P/tmp ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/

   â€¢ You want to download all the GIFs from a directory on an HTTP
     server.  You tried â€˜wget http://www.example.com/dir/*.gifâ€™, but
     that didnâ€™t work because HTTP retrieval does not support globbing.
     In that case, use:

          wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.example.com/dir/

     More verbose, but the effect is the same.  â€˜-r -l1â€™ means to
     retrieve recursively (*note Recursive Download::), with maximum
     depth of 1.  â€˜--no-parentâ€™ means that references to the parent
     directory are ignored (*note Directory-Based Limits::), and
     â€˜-A.gifâ€™ means to download only the GIF files.  â€˜-A "*.gif"â€™ would
     have worked too.

   â€¢ Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was
     interrupted.  Now you do not want to clobber the files already
     present.  It would be:

          wget -nc -r https://www.gnu.org/

   â€¢ If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or
     FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (*note URL Format::).

          wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@unix.example.com/.emacs

     Note, however, that this usage is not advisable on multi-user
     systems because it reveals your password to anyone who looks at the
     output of â€˜psâ€™.

   â€¢ You would like the output documents to go to standard output
     instead of to files?

          wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/

     You can also combine the two options and make pipelines to retrieve
     the documents from remote hotlists:

          wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i -

7.3 Very Advanced Usage
=======================

   â€¢ If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP
     subdirectories), use â€˜--mirrorâ€™ (â€˜-mâ€™), which is the shorthand for
     â€˜-r -l inf -Nâ€™.  You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to
     recheck a site each Sunday:

          crontab
          0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror https://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

   â€¢ In addition to the above, you want the links to be converted for
     local viewing.  But, after having read this manual, you know that
     link conversion doesnâ€™t play well with timestamping, so you also
     want Wget to back up the original HTML files before the conversion.
     Wget invocation would look like this:

          wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted  \
               https://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

   â€¢ But youâ€™ve also noticed that local viewing doesnâ€™t work all that
     well when HTML files are saved under extensions other than â€˜.htmlâ€™,
     perhaps because they were served as â€˜index.cgiâ€™.  So youâ€™d like
     Wget to rename all the files served with content-type â€˜text/htmlâ€™
     or â€˜application/xhtml+xmlâ€™ to â€˜NAME.htmlâ€™.

          wget --mirror --convert-links --backup-converted \
               --html-extension -o /home/me/weeklog        \
               https://www.gnu.org/

     Or, with less typing:

          wget -m -k -K -E https://www.gnu.org/ -o /home/me/weeklog

*********

This chapter contains all the stuff that could not fit anywhere else.

8.1 Proxies
===========

â€œProxiesâ€ are special-purpose HTTP servers designed to transfer data
from remote servers to local clients.  One typical use of proxies is
lightening network load for users behind a slow connection.  This is
achieved by channeling all HTTP and FTP requests through the proxy which
caches the transferred data.  When a cached resource is requested again,
proxy will return the data from cache.  Another use for proxies is for
companies that separate (for security reasons) their internal networks
from the rest of Internet.  In order to obtain information from the Web,
their users connect and retrieve remote data using an authorized proxy.

   Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The standard
way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is using the
following environment variables:

â€˜http_proxyâ€™
â€˜https_proxyâ€™
     If set, the â€˜http_proxyâ€™ and â€˜https_proxyâ€™ variables should contain
     the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS connections
     respectively.

â€˜ftp_proxyâ€™
     This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP
     connections.  It is quite common that â€˜http_proxyâ€™ and â€˜ftp_proxyâ€™
     are set to the same URL.

â€˜no_proxyâ€™
     This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain
     extensions proxy should _not_ be used for.  For instance, if the
     value of â€˜no_proxyâ€™ is â€˜.mit.eduâ€™, proxy will not be used to
     retrieve documents from MIT.

   In addition to the environment variables, proxy location and settings
may be specified from within Wget itself.

â€˜--no-proxyâ€™
â€˜proxy = on/offâ€™
     This option and the corresponding command may be used to suppress
     the use of proxy, even if the appropriate environment variables are
     set.

â€˜http_proxy = URLâ€™
â€˜https_proxy = URLâ€™
â€˜ftp_proxy = URLâ€™
â€˜no_proxy = STRINGâ€™
     These startup file variables allow you to override the proxy
     settings specified by the environment.

   Some proxy servers require authorization to enable you to use them.
The authorization consists of â€œusernameâ€ and â€œpasswordâ€, which must be
sent by Wget.  As with HTTP authorization, several authentication
schemes exist.  For proxy authorization only the â€˜Basicâ€™ authentication
scheme is currently implemented.

   You may specify your username and password either through the proxy
URL or through the command-line options.  Assuming that the companyâ€™s
proxy is located at â€˜proxy.company.comâ€™ at port 8001, a proxy URL
location containing authorization data might look like this:

     http://hniksic:mypassword@proxy.company.com:8001/

   Alternatively, you may use the â€˜proxy-userâ€™ and â€˜proxy-passwordâ€™
options, and the equivalent â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ settings â€˜proxy_userâ€™ and
â€˜proxy_passwordâ€™ to set the proxy username and password.

8.2 Distribution
================

Like all GNU utilities, the latest version of Wget can be found at the
master GNU archive site ftp.gnu.org, and its mirrors.  For example, Wget
1.21.1-dirty can be found at
<https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/wget-1.21.1-dirty.tar.gz>

8.3 Web Site
============

The official web site for GNU Wget is at
<https//www.gnu.org/software/wget/>.  However, most useful information
resides at â€œThe Wget Wgikiâ€, <http://wget.addictivecode.org/>.

8.4 Mailing Lists
=================

Primary List
------------

The primary mailinglist for discussion, bug-reports, or questions about
GNU Wget is at <bug-wget@gnu.org>.  To subscribe, send an email to
<bug-wget-join@gnu.org>, or visit
<https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget>.

   You do not need to subscribe to send a message to the list; however,
please note that unsubscribed messages are moderated, and may take a
while before they hit the listâ€”*usually around a day*.  If you want your
message to show up immediately, please subscribe to the list before
posting.  Archives for the list may be found at
<https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/>.

   An NNTP/Usenettish gateway is also available via Gmane
(http://gmane.org/about.php).  You can see the Gmane archives at
<http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general>.  Note that the
Gmane archives conveniently include messages from both the current list,
and the previous one.  Messages also show up in the Gmane archives
sooner than they do at <https://lists.gnu.org>.

Obsolete Lists
--------------

Previously, the mailing list <wget@sunsite.dk> was used as the main
discussion list, and another list, <wget-patches@sunsite.dk> was used
for submitting and discussing patches to GNU Wget.

   Messages from <wget@sunsite.dk> are archived at
     <https://www.mail-archive.com/wget%40sunsite.dk/> and at
     <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.general> (which also
     continues to archive the current list, <bug-wget@gnu.org>).

   Messages from <wget-patches@sunsite.dk> are archived at
     <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.wget.patches>.

8.5 Internet Relay Chat
=======================

In addition to the mailinglists, we also have a support channel set up
via IRC at â€˜irc.freenode.orgâ€™, â€˜#wgetâ€™.  Come check it out!

8.6 Reporting Bugs
==================

You are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug tracker (see
<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&group=wget>) or to our
mailing list <bug-wget@gnu.org>.

   Visit <https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget> to get more
info (how to subscribe, list archives, ...).

   Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.

  1. Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.
     If Wget crashes, itâ€™s a bug.  If Wget does not behave as
     documented, itâ€™s a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not
     sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a
     bug, but you might want to double-check the documentation and the
     mailing lists (*note Mailing Lists::).

  2. Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g.
     if Wget crashes while downloading â€˜wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy
     http://example.com -o /tmp/logâ€™, you should try to see if the crash
     is repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options.
     You might even try to start the download at the page where the
     crash occurred to see if that page somehow triggered the crash.

     Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of
     your â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ file, just dumping it into the debug message is
     probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the
     bug repeats with â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ moved out of the way.  Only if it turns
     out that â€˜.wgetrcâ€™ settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant
     parts of the file.

  3. Please start Wget with â€˜-dâ€™ option and send us the resulting output
     (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled without debug
     support, recompile itâ€”it is _much_ easier to trace bugs with debug
     support on.

     Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive
     information from the debug log before sending it to the bug
     address.  The â€˜-dâ€™ wonâ€™t go out of its way to collect sensitive
     information, but the log _will_ contain a fairly complete
     transcript of Wgetâ€™s communication with the server, which may
     include passwords and pieces of downloaded data.  Since the bug
     address is publicly archived, you may assume that all bug reports
     are visible to the public.

  4. If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g.  â€˜gdb `which
     wget` coreâ€™ and type â€˜whereâ€™ to get the backtrace.  This may not
     work if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is
     safe to try.

8.7 Portability
===============

Like all GNU software, Wget works on the GNU system.  However, since it
uses GNU Autoconf for building and configuring, and mostly avoids using
â€œspecialâ€ features of any particular Unix, it should compile (and work)
on all common Unix flavors.

   Various Wget versions have been compiled and tested under many kinds
of Unix systems, including GNU/Linux, Solaris, SunOS 4.x, Mac OS X, OSF
(aka Digital Unix or Tru64), Ultrix, *BSD, IRIX, AIX, and others.  Some
of those systems are no longer in widespread use and may not be able to
support recent versions of Wget.  If Wget fails to compile on your
system, we would like to know about it.

   Thanks to kind contributors, this version of Wget compiles and works
on 32-bit Microsoft Windows platforms.  It has been compiled
successfully using MS Visual C++ 6.0, Watcom, Borland C, and GCC
compilers.  Naturally, it is crippled of some features available on
Unix, but it should work as a substitute for people stuck with Windows.
Note that Windows-specific portions of Wget are not guaranteed to be
supported in the future, although this has been the case in practice for
many years now.  All questions and problems in Windows usage should be
reported to Wget mailing list at <wget@sunsite.dk> where the volunteers
who maintain the Windows-related features might look at them.

   Support for building on MS-DOS via DJGPP has been contributed by
Gisle Vanem; a port to VMS is maintained by Steven Schweda, and is
available at <https://antinode.info/dec/sw/wget.html>.

8.8 Signals
===========

Since the purpose of Wget is background work, it catches the hangup
signal (â€˜SIGHUPâ€™) and ignores it.  If the output was on standard output,
it will be redirected to a file named â€˜wget-logâ€™.  Otherwise, â€˜SIGHUPâ€™
is ignored.  This is convenient when you wish to redirect the output of
Wget after having started it.

     $ wget http://www.gnus.org/dist/gnus.tar.gz &
     ...
     $ kill -HUP %%
     SIGHUP received, redirecting output to `wget-log'.

   Other than that, Wget will not try to interfere with signals in any
way.  â€˜C-câ€™, â€˜kill -TERMâ€™ and â€˜kill -KILLâ€™ should kill it alike.

9 Appendices
************

This chapter contains some references I consider useful.

9.1 Robot Exclusion
===================

It is extremely easy to make Wget wander aimlessly around a web site,
sucking all the available data in progress.  â€˜wget -r SITEâ€™, and youâ€™re
set.  Great?  Not for the server admin.

   As long as Wget is only retrieving static pages, and doing it at a
reasonable rate (see the â€˜--waitâ€™ option), thereâ€™s not much of a
problem.  The trouble is that Wget canâ€™t tell the difference between the
smallest static page and the most demanding CGI. A site I know has a
section handled by a CGI Perl script that converts Info files to HTML on
the fly.  The script is slow, but works well enough for human users
viewing an occasional Info file.  However, when someoneâ€™s recursive Wget
download stumbles upon the index page that links to all the Info files
through the script, the system is brought to its knees without providing
anything useful to the user (This task of converting Info files could be
done locally and access to Info documentation for all installed GNU
software on a system is available from the â€˜infoâ€™ command).

   To avoid this kind of accident, as well as to preserve privacy for
documents that need to be protected from well-behaved robots, the
concept of â€œrobot exclusionâ€ was invented.  The idea is that the server
administrators and document authors can specify which portions of the
site they wish to protect from robots and those they will permit access.

   The most popular mechanism, and the de facto standard supported by
all the major robots, is the â€œRobots Exclusion Standardâ€ (RES) written
by Martijn Koster et al.  in 1994.  It specifies the format of a text
file containing directives that instruct the robots which URL paths to
avoid.  To be found by the robots, the specifications must be placed in
â€˜/robots.txtâ€™ in the server root, which the robots are expected to
download and parse.

   Although Wget is not a web robot in the strictest sense of the word,
it can download large parts of the site without the userâ€™s intervention
to download an individual page.  Because of that, Wget honors RES when
downloading recursively.  For instance, when you issue:

     wget -r http://www.example.com/

   First the index of â€˜www.example.comâ€™ will be downloaded.  If Wget
finds that it wants to download more documents from that server, it will
request â€˜http://www.example.com/robots.txtâ€™ and, if found, use it for
further downloads.  â€˜robots.txtâ€™ is loaded only once per each server.

   Until version 1.8, Wget supported the first version of the standard,
written by Martijn Koster in 1994 and available at
<http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html>.  As of version 1.8, Wget has
supported the additional directives specified in the internet draft
â€˜<draft-koster-robots-00.txt>â€™ titled â€œA Method for Web Robots Controlâ€.
The draft, which has as far as I know never made to an RFC, is available
at <http://www.robotstxt.org/norobots-rfc.txt>.

   This manual no longer includes the text of the Robot Exclusion
Standard.

   The second, less known mechanism, enables the author of an individual
document to specify whether they want the links from the file to be
followed by a robot.  This is achieved using the â€˜METAâ€™ tag, like this:

     <meta name="robots" content="nofollow">

   This is explained in some detail at
<http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html>.  Wget supports this method of
robot exclusion in addition to the usual â€˜/robots.txtâ€™ exclusion.

   If you know what you are doing and really really wish to turn off the
robot exclusion, set the â€˜robotsâ€™ variable to â€˜offâ€™ in your â€˜.wgetrcâ€™.
You can achieve the same effect from the command line using the â€˜-eâ€™
switch, e.g.  â€˜wget -e robots=off URL...â€™.

9.2 Security Considerations
===========================

When using Wget, you must be aware that it sends unencrypted passwords
through the network, which may present a security problem.  Here are the
main issues, and some solutions.

  1. The passwords on the command line are visible using â€˜psâ€™.  The best
     way around it is to use â€˜wget -i -â€™ and feed the URLs to Wgetâ€™s
     standard input, each on a separate line, terminated by â€˜C-dâ€™.
     Another workaround is to use â€˜.netrcâ€™ to store passwords; however,
     storing unencrypted passwords is also considered a security risk.

  2. Using the insecure â€œbasicâ€ authentication scheme, unencrypted
     passwords are transmitted through the network routers and gateways.

  3. The FTP passwords are also in no way encrypted.  There is no good
     solution for this at the moment.

  4. Although the â€œnormalâ€ output of Wget tries to hide the passwords,
     debugging logs show them, in all forms.  This problem is avoided by
     being careful when you send debug logs (yes, even when you send
     them to me).

9.3 Contributors
================

GNU Wget was written by Hrvoje NikÅ¡iÄ‡ <hniksic@xemacs.org>,

   However, the development of Wget could never have gone as far as it
has, were it not for the help of many people, either with bug reports,
feature proposals, patches, or letters saying â€œThanks!â€.

   Special thanks goes to the following people (no particular order):

   â€¢ Dan Harklessâ€”contributed a lot of code and documentation of
     extremely high quality, as well as the â€˜--page-requisitesâ€™ and
     related options.  He was the principal maintainer for some time and
     released Wget 1.6.

   â€¢ Ian Abbottâ€”contributed bug fixes, Windows-related fixes, and
     provided a prototype implementation of the breadth-first recursive
     download.  Co-maintained Wget during the 1.8 release cycle.

   â€¢ The dotsrc.org crew, in particular Karsten Thygesenâ€”donated system
     resources such as the mailing list, web space, FTP space, and
     version control repositories, along with a lot of time to make
     these actually work.  Christian Reiniger was of invaluable help
     with setting up Subversion.

   â€¢ Heiko Heroldâ€”provided high-quality Windows builds and contributed
     bug and build reports for many years.

   â€¢ Shawn McHorseâ€”bug reports and patches.

   â€¢ Kaveh R. Ghaziâ€”on-the-fly â€˜ansi2knrâ€™-ization.  Lots of portability
     fixes.

   â€¢ Gordon Matzigkeitâ€”â€˜.netrcâ€™ support.

   â€¢ Zlatko ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡, Tomislav Vujec and DraÅ¾en KaÄarâ€”feature suggestions
     and â€œphilosophicalâ€ discussions.

   â€¢ Darko Budorâ€”initial port to Windows.

   â€¢ Antonio Rosellaâ€”help and suggestions, plus the initial Italian
     translation.

   â€¢ Tomislav PetroviÄ‡, Mario MikoÄeviÄ‡â€”many bug reports and
     suggestions.

   â€¢ FranÃ§is Pinardâ€”many thorough bug reports and discussions.

   â€¢ Karl Eichwalderâ€”lots of help with internationalization, Makefile
     layout and many other things.

   â€¢ Junio Hamanoâ€”donated support for Opie and HTTP â€˜Digestâ€™
     authentication.

   â€¢ Mauro Tortonesiâ€”improved IPv6 support, adding support for dual
     family systems.  Refactored and enhanced FTP IPv6 code.  Maintained
     GNU Wget from 2004â€“2007.

   â€¢ Christopher G. Lewisâ€”maintenance of the Windows version of GNU
     WGet.

   â€¢ Gisle Vanemâ€”many helpful patches and improvements, especially for
     Windows and MS-DOS support.

   â€¢ Ralf Wildenhuesâ€”contributed patches to convert Wget to use Automake
     as part of its build process, and various bugfixes.

   â€¢ Steven Schubigerâ€”Many helpful patches, bugfixes and improvements.
     Notably, conversion of Wget to use the Gnulib quotes and quoteargs
     modules, and the addition of password prompts at the console, via
     the Gnulib getpasswd-gnu module.

   â€¢ Ted Mielczarekâ€”donated support for CSS.

   â€¢ Saint Xavierâ€”Support for IRIs (RFC 3987).

   â€¢ Tim RÃ¼hsenâ€”Loads of helpful patches, especially fuzzing support and
     Continuous Integration.  Maintainer since 2014.

   â€¢ Darshit Shahâ€”Many helpful patches.  Community support on various
     platforms.  Maintainer since 2014.

   â€¢ People who provided donations for developmentâ€”including Brian
     Gough.

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright Â© 2000â€“2002, 2007â€“2008, 2015, 2018â€“2021 Free
     Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document â€œfreeâ€ in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of â€œcopyleftâ€, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     â€œDocumentâ€, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as â€œyouâ€.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A â€œModified Versionâ€ of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A â€œSecondary Sectionâ€ is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Documentâ€™s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The â€œInvariant Sectionsâ€ are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The â€œCover Textsâ€ are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A â€œTransparentâ€ copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     â€œTransparentâ€ is called â€œOpaqueâ€.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The â€œTitle Pageâ€ means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, â€œTitle
     Pageâ€ means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     workâ€™s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The â€œpublisherâ€ means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section â€œEntitled XYZâ€ means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     â€œAcknowledgementsâ€, â€œDedicationsâ€, â€œEndorsementsâ€, or â€œHistoryâ€.)
     To â€œPreserve the Titleâ€ of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section â€œEntitled XYZâ€ according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Documentâ€™s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Documentâ€™s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled â€œHistoryâ€, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled â€œHistoryâ€ in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          â€œHistoryâ€ section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled â€œAcknowledgementsâ€ or â€œDedicationsâ€,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled â€œEndorsementsâ€.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          â€œEndorsementsâ€ or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Versionâ€™s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled â€œEndorsementsâ€, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     partiesâ€”for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     â€œHistoryâ€ in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled â€œHistoryâ€; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     â€œAcknowledgementsâ€, and any sections Entitled â€œDedicationsâ€.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled â€œEndorsements.â€

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an â€œaggregateâ€ if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilationâ€™s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Documentâ€™s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled â€œAcknowledgementsâ€,
     â€œDedicationsâ€, or â€œHistoryâ€, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License â€œor any later versionâ€ applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxyâ€™s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     â€œMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Siteâ€ (or â€œMMC Siteâ€) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A â€œMassive Multiauthor Collaborationâ€ (or â€œMMCâ€) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     â€œCC-BY-SAâ€ means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     â€œIncorporateâ€ means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is â€œeligible for relicensingâ€ if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the â€œwith...Texts.â€ line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
